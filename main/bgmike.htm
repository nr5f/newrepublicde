When Michael joined the Imperial Academy he had no idea of the war that would follow. Michael didn't thought on making a career in the Imperial navy. He wasn't that tall and the other students in his class in the school or the cadets on the academy usually had higher condition.
Michael passed the academy like everyone on his planet and got asigned to a minor position as shuttle copilot for Lambda Class shuttles. After some months Michael got promoted to Second Lieutenant and again some months later to lieutenant. In his second year Michael was pilot of a shuttle himself.
His service to the empire was almost done when the Rebellion started in his sub sector. The empire had lost several pilots though upsprings, others turned the sides. A few thousant fresh prduced TIE Fighters were seeking for new pilots. Michael followed the call of the empire and joined the training for TIE pilots.
<br>
<br>As fighter pilot Michael got asigned to the FRG Treesta that was on the way to Chorrak to regain Imperial control over the system again after an upspring. The Treesta and two more frigates were the first Imperial contigentes that have arrived in the system. The frigates got trapped and Michael was one of the few Imperial soldiers that survived that battle. Michael got transferred to the ISD Vernichter that replaced the lost Imperial contingent. In this conflict Michael had some luck with his carreer.
He managed to survive a few battle against the outdated fighters and bombers of the Chorrakean seperatists, and he fired a lucky shot against a Chorrakean platform with shields down that destroyed the platform, so he managed to climb up in ranks. By the end of the conflict, Michael was Commander and asigned to a TIE Interceptor Squadron. He was supposed for getting Wing Commander, but in a last battle Michael's fighter got damaged and he got injured at his leg.
He recovered some time in a hospital, but his fighter carreer ended as fast as it started. Before Michael's carreer completely ended Admiral Zortak sent him to Coruscant for propaganda reasons.
<br>
<br>Maybe it was fate, maybe it was the force, maybe just a coincedence, but Michael arrived on his way to Coruscant on the ISD Lotward short time after Lord Vader had arrived on the ship himself. After a lost battle against a group of smaller Rebel ships the Lord of the Sith had removed the surviving higher ranking officers from their position. Vader had some special plans with Michael, but first he needed a new commander for the Lotward.
Michael got promoted to captain and obsever the reconstructuring of the Lotward. Lieutenant Marina Braun became the first officer of the Lotward. In the first fight of the ISD Lotward under the command of Captain Simon in the battle of Hoth the Lotward hunted Alliance ships fleeing from the planet. The Lotward moved through a couple of system triing to catch smaller Alliance groups.
Vader had asigned Michael to a secret base where a group of lower Sith were training the force. Michael had some kind of blockade and a lack of ambition so he didn't experiance the Dark Side as much as the other Sith. Michael finally got removed from unit after he had learned the basic skills of the Dark Side.
<br>
<br>Michael could have left the Imperial navy now, but he had served the Empire for some years now and had already reached a respectable rank, so he searched for a new position in the navy.
On Admiral Zaarin's offer Michael got Commodore and part of the scientific staff that worked on the weapons research. Michael worked on several projects for Admiral Zaarin and later on the construction of the second Death Star.
After the Battle of Endor the Empire was in a desolate situation. Michael, meanwhile Vice Admiral, returned to the navy, where he was one of those commanders that tried to regain control over the galaxy again. Michael fought the following years against upsrings and the Rebel Alliance. He got soon Fleet Executive Officer and later temporary Fleet Commander of the 7th fleet. After the victory at Trakas, where the 7th encycled an Alliance fleet, Michael became admiral and Fleet Commander of the 11th fleet, and he made Vice Admiral Marina Braun the Fleet Executive Officer.
<br>
<br>With the 11th fleet Michael spent years in the outer regions. When he returned the empire had broken into pieces. In several battles with Alliance fleets the 11th fleet suffered under several losses.
What was left of the 11th fleet joined different remnant leaders. Michael returned with the ASD Prometheus, the flagship of the 5th fleet and a few more Stardestroyers to the Corollard Nimbus. Meanwhile Vice Admiral Braun joined the Aran Hirarchy with other parts of the fleet.
Lord Admiral Enning, the former Director of the regular navy was leading several Imperial fleets from the Nimbus. Michael got promoted to Fleet Admiral and reconstructed the 5th fleet with aditional ships from the former 11th fleet. While the 5th fleet fought against Republican fleets Aran forces destroyed the Corollard Nimbus. 
The High Command got moved to Delasol, Michael got Assistant Director of the navy and climbed up in the ranks. The conflicts with the other fractions started to increase and Michael started to draw a harder line against the other Imperial fracions.
<br>
<br>It took some time till Michael got Director. Meanwhile Grand Admiral he started big campaigns against the other Imperial fractions. Michael had managed to bring some smaller Imperial Lords and Governors on his side and had defeated some others before he started his last great campaign as Director of the navy.
Lord Admiral Donaarn's in the Outer Rim was shrinking, Warlord Horus was strong before, but he was almost controlling the area now. He had attacked several smaller areas of other Imperial warlords, he even attacked the 5th fleet, but he had conentrated on less important territories so noone really cared for him before. But he had brought a few smaller fragments of the remnants on his side after he had launched a massive attack against the Aran Hirarchy. That incident was the first time Horus shown his real strength.
Michael had a lot of support from the Imperial remnant when he attacked Warlord Horus' territories while Horus forces were concentrated on the invasion of the Aran Hirarchy. While the first attacks started several high ranking officers turned sides, entire ships started to cooperate with the fleets of Warlord Horus, who had moved parts of his navy here cause the officers that turned sides informed him about the invasion before. After several weeks of battles over large parts of the territories of Warlord Horus both sides giant casaulties and Michael's forces retreated from the outer Rim, loosing a lot of territories there.
