<p class="textbig" align="center"><b>Background</b></p>

<p class="text"><img src="bgmike.gif" border="0" align="right">In the Imperial times the 5th fleet consisted of 10 battlegroups, each of them consisting of 5 carrier groups. When Grand Admiral Michael Simon got navy commander the Imperial Remnant was in a desperate state. Loyality was a rare good in this times so Michael selected the personnel of the 1st battlegroup from the most loyal navy officers. The empire was already shattered in these times and the warlords fought against each other. Like any other Imperial commanders Michael tried to bring large contingents of the Imperial remnants together, but he got more and more drawn into the conflicts between the different fractions. Michael made many compromises to convince several Imperial warlords to follow him and fought against those who didn't. On the day of the great split great parts of Michaels fleets turned against him. Battles started on almost each ship and when a side dominated a ship, the ship fought against those dominated by the other side. After the destruction of the 5th fleets flagship, the Eclipse Class Superstardestroyer Dominant, Battlegroup One build the first line of defense of the loyalists. Michael and his allies turned to the New Republic and build the Fallen.</p>
<p class="text">The Fallen kept many of their military traditions, they still wear Imperial uniforms and use Imperial equipment. When the Fallen joined the New Republic the remaining Stormtrooper units got dropped and the soldiers got integrated into normal infantry units. The Secret Order and familiar sith or emperor dependent units got disbanned. And the Fallen changed to the Republican jurisdiction. The Fallen still have several fleets besides Battlegroup One. The Basic unit for all the fleets is the Carrier Group consisting of a stardestroyer and a few smaller escort ships, usually corellian corvettes or gunships or lancer frigates. Senior officers are throning from the bridges of the stardesroyers over the citys in space like the warlords of the Remnants.</p>
<p class="text"><img src="bghuang.gif" border="0" align="left">70 percent of the military of the Fallen are clones. Clones technically have the same genetical code as humans, but the selection of the gene code, the increased aging and the military training during their childhood drastically builds the character of the clones. For the Fallen, clones are still the best soldiers. Most clones are male, but in the last years a few female series had been brought out. Humans are just the second choise but some of the humans are unique characters in the Fallen navy. Just a few human lookalike beings manage it into the navy, most of them are androids with hulls in forms of human. They are difficult to identify between humans but they have more strength then normal humans. Different to normal droids this androids have high developed artificial intelligence so they are able to develop their own character. But they still have a basic programming that prevents them from doing actions specified by the programmers. A hand full of personnel in the navy are humanoids like the chiss.</p>
<p class="text">The fleets of the Fallen completely consist of former Imperial technology. The Fallen have many stardestroyers and other ships from the times they were Imperials. Meanwhile these ships have been reequipped with modern weapon systems, shields and energy reactors. A few of the Fallen stardestroyers have been ordered by KDY in the newer times, but all of these have been financed privatly or by the local governors, cause the High Command of the New Republican navy isn't very happy seeing the Fallen still use Imperial equipment. TIE Fighters, TIE Bombers and TIE Interceptors build the basic fighters of the Fallen. All of them have been reequipeed with better lasers, better engines and deflector shields. The missing hyperdrive still limits the mission range of the fighters and bombers. TIE Avengers and TIE Defenders are pretty rare in the Fallen military services, because the contacts to Sienar Fleet Systems are pretty bad since the Fallen turned to the Republic. On the other hand it became easier getting new medium size warships like Corellian Corvettes and Gunships.</p>
<p class="text">The Fallen still wear their Imperial Uniforms, just the grey navy or army ones. Uniforms in different colors have been replaced with grey ones. On the ships military personnel usually waers plain uniforms, soldiers aditionally wear basic grey Imperial helmets. On planets soldiers often wear grey breastplates aditionally to the helmets or uniform coats depending on weather and temperature. Many of the older Fallen officers wear relicts they have earned in the Empire like daggers of the honor legion. Imperial logos on the arms have been exchanged with New Republican ones, in case there were some, but Imperial logos on medals and pilot wings or familiar emblems remained.</p>
<p class="text"><img src="bgmarina.gif" border="0" align="right">The ground forcers are splitten into two parts: The naval infantry that is asigned to the different space ships and the army that is stationed on the planets. While the main forces of army and naval infantry are clones, most of the reserve units are battledroid regiments. Even in the Imperial times the Fallen replaced many combat units with battledroids, because they started to run out of clones and humans so they needed fast produceable battledroids to hold the frontlines. Higher durability, higher will to survive and much higher intelligence make clones much better soldiers then battledroids so holding frontlines with droid forces was ever just a temporary solution till the droids could be replaced with normal army units or the forces could have been withdrawn from a planet. The Fallen ground forces don't have many AT-ATs and AT-STs left. Most of them got destroyed in the conflicts with the Imperial warlords and it was a problem to get new ones on the side of the Republic. The few remaining vehicles are protected like treasures and get modified and upgraded pretty often. The basic ground vehicle of the Fallen is the AAT. The few remaining Dark Trooper units are threated like holy relics. A few of the higher stardestroyer captains have one or two Dark Troopers to guard their bridges.</p>
<p class="text">The motivation of most of the Fallen to join the New Republic was to restore the Republic and end the chaos the Empire brought upon the galaxy. Especially those that grew up in the Republic have that motivation. Others just want revenge for deeds other Imperial warlords did or they want to hide theirself from the revenge of Imperial warlords. There are also a lot of Imperial shards that joined the Fallen cause their leaders were tired of the continous struggle for power in the Imperial remnant. The fallen are much different from the Imperials that turned to the Rebel Alliance earlier. These people were young idealistic officers that fought against the cruels of the Imperial government. The Fallen are more Imperial veterans that served the empire for a long time. They are fighting against the Imperial warlordism and decandence.</p>
<p class="text">Different to the fleets of the old empire the fleets of the Fallen aren't as strictly structured. Officially most of the carrier groups are asigned to the Delasol or Maja defnse forces, but usually they opperate more independently. The Fallen have core units like Battlegroup One of the 5th fleet, the 1st Delasol Defense Fleet and the 1st Maja Defense fleet. Most of the other carrier groups vary on their asignments. Most of their time they defend the Fallen territories but when the Delasol Defense fleet is attacked by Imperial Remnant invaders or when the Republic sends Battlegroup One against Imperial warlords in the Outer Rim, those carrier groups join the core units on their tasks. Cause of their pre-Republican experiances of the wars against the other Imperial fractions and cause of the experiances of the great split with the empire where comrade fought against comrade, holding together is one of the most important valors of the Fallen and many of teir leaders are on a sort of crusade against the Imperial warlords. So it happens that Battlegroup One grows to a unit of 10 to 20 carrier groups while an opperation against an Imperial warlord.</p>
<p class="text"><img src="bgniko.gif" border="0" align="left">The stardestroyers in Battlegroup One are pretty new; none of them got build in the time before the battle of Endor. The older ships of the fleet like the Imperium Class Stardestroyer Gizmotronic or the Victory Class Stardestroyer Ratio got destroyed over the time. The Amageddon Class Stardestroyer Prometheus is the Flagship of the Battlegroup One since the 5th fleet turned to the Republic and replaced the Eclipse Class Stardestroyer Dominant that got destroyed in the fights against the Imperial Remnants in the time of the split.</p>
<p class="text">The base for Battlegroup One is Delasol. The Stephanus Spacedock is a small platform in the orbit of Delasol. The platform has the capacity to dock eight Imperium Class Stardestroyers or smaller versions and two stardestroyers up to the size of a Superstardestroyer. Several buildings in the Delasol military quarter are reserved for Battlegroup One. Delasol is often seen as the homeworld of the Fallen. The goverments of Fallen planets are usually federations and the bigger planets have a seat in the galactic senat.</p>
