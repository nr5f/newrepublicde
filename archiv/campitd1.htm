<h1>Into the Darkness Part I: Beginning of the end</h1>

<p class="text">
Grand Admiral Michael Simon was walking through the restricted areas of the Navy headquarters on Coruscant wearing the white uniform of an Imperial Grand Admiral with the bag full of medals he earned in his career. He had just left the conference of the senate where he gave a small report on Remnant activities in the Outer Rim regions. Sometimes he felt more like a marionette then someone in charge of something, he didn't even write the report himself, he got it from one of the attachés of one of the higher admirals in the ministry of defense. The conference took a bit longer then expected so he was a bit late for his next meeting, this time with some of the admirals in the planning staff. The admirals were in the middle of the discussion and the holo-map in the middle of the room was already showing a couple of planned moves.
<br><br>"Ahh, Michael, we already waited on you. There is a mission for the 5th fleet we would like to discuss with you. ..."
<br><br><br>Meanwhile in the Maja system. The Angel of Darkness and the other ships of Battlegroup Hunter were filling their cargo bays with new ammunition while High Admiral Angelus was feeling some coming arrival. Just in the moment Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar was leaving hyperspace a few hundred meters in front of the Angel, facing towards the ship, in the following seconds the Warspite and half a dozen Corellian Corvettes left hyperspace behind their flagship. Commy must have paid a lot for this dramatic appearance. The holographic display of the smiling High Admiral Corran Skywalker appeared in front of Worf.
<br><br>"Here for stocking up your resources as well? ..."
<br><br><br>"Well, time to get into your new job, Admiral." Vice Admiral Wolverine said while he and Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler were moving along the docking corridor of the Tenedart Nimbus in the orbit of Delasol towards the Prometheus. "We are ordered to meet with the other battlegroups in Maja, and we will get our briefing for the next mission there."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<p class="text">
The rest of Liedan's group formed up behind him as the returned to the Warspite from their patrol run. "This is White 3-1 to Warspite requesting permission to board." He announced over the com channel as he maneuvered the B-wing into boarding position.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Liedan Aish</p>

<p class="text">
Mike nooded his head in agreement with Wolverine about getting back with his new job and back onboard the Prometheus.Which at the time was docked at the spacestation Tenedart Nimbus in the orbit of Delasol.After they boarded the Prometheus and Wolverine leading the way to the bridge Mike hoped.But he never could tell with Wolverine what he as in store for him.So he spoke up because Mike like to know something.
<br><br>"Admiral,if you don't mind me asking.,?" Mike saw the look on Wolverine's face that told a million words,"Whats going on that has us meeting with the other battlegroups of the Fifth Fleet in the Maja System..Then turn around and wait for forth orders and being debrief at Maja..I like to know,sir,so I won't be left in the dark?"
</p>

High Admiral Corran Skywalker was standing in front of a few hundred officers in a large conference room on the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar.
<br><br>"Everything ready?" He asked to a communications officer with a datapad standing near to him.
<br><br>"Aye sir, secured communications with all ships of the fleet have been established."
<br><br>"Ok, thanks lieutenant."
<br><br>The High Admiral, was making a few steps forward, so the crowd of officers could better see him.
<br><br>"For years we are fighting against the remnants now and meanwhile. While most of the remnant fractions have been extincted or seriously decimated and retreated to the region around Bastion there is one last opponent still operating in our neighborhood and we are doing the final strike.
<br><br>I guess our opponent is well known, it's Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin. Most of you have already dealt with his fleets in the first months of the year. After our campaign his fleets were seriously weakened so the other Republican forces in the area managed to push him further back to his key systems. While the others are pretty much busy with clearing the conquered systems from the remnants of Warlord Horus forces we are fully equipped and motivated to launch a massive attack on his capitol world.
<br><br>Their capitol world is Zarathos how they call it; in the Republican Database you will find it as the 5th planet of Prengos Zeta Phi a pretty much lifeless rock, that's why we didn't find it over the years. They have somehow managed to terraform the planet; it's not sure how the worlds looks like now, but we know the world has a population of over a billion.
<br><br>A long range sonde identified several large metal objects in the orbit of the world. All ships trying to get a closer scan of the situation there have been shot down before transmitting data. But we are expecting his main capitol ships being there as well as a lot of platforms.
<br><br>As soon as the entire fleet has been assembled here and fully crewed and stocked up their requirements we'll move to Sara Sepentis Delta. The Hamburg is already there and protecting a new refuel station there. Grand Admiral Simon is also on the way there. From there we take a direct hyperjump to Zarathos and take down everything that turns against us. If necessary we can get reinforcements from the other Republican fleets around.
<br><br>So good luck everyone and may the force be with you."

Thes sat in his office working through the daily pile of paperwork. The Predator and the rest of Battle Group Hunter were taking on supplies. His personal ship was stored in the "Captain's Bay", opposed to the normal assigned Shuttle.
<br><br>A young officer entered the room, stopping to hold a salute. Finishing his paper he started more to test the young man than for need of finishing, he set it aside and finally returned the salute. "Yes, Ensign, what's up?"
<br><br>"Sir, I'm to inform you were about half done with reloading. We still have munitions and spare parts to load, but all consumables are on board and the Mess Chief has his crew stowing them."
<br><br>Thes nodded, "Ok, when we are loaded up, bring us to high orbit to await the rest of the Fleet to rearm." Dismissing the Ensign, Thes went back to work. He felt a beer calling him when he was done, and he busied himself even more.

Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler got his answer that he was looking for while standing on the command bridge of the Prometheus. Wolverine didn't have to answer his question one bit but High Admiral Corran Skywalker answered all the questions that was in his head that need to be answered. 'Great' thought Mike ' this will be fun and many lives will be lost during the battle over this planet'. Mike turn and looked around the bridge to see that each and everyone on the bridge was uncomfortable or ready for combat.Even Mike himself was ready for the final show down with Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin forces.So Mike asked for permission to leave the bridge and head to the main hanger bay to get his personal X-wing ready for Combat along with the his IE Interceptor advance .
<br><br>Mike didn't mind one bit because he wouldn't mind flying the IE Interceptor advance into battle and show off his skill in a IE Interceptor advance against Hours' forces.Which Wolverine' granted this and Mike left the bridge to head off to the main hanger bay.Even while heading to the main hanger bay Mike decided to order his Squadron Commanders to meet him in the main hanger bay so he can debrief them about the up coming battle.

<p class="text">
Considering the meeting of the group had taken place on his ship, he was, of course there, at the helm of the Zentar. He had listened to the briefing, but had not asked any questions during it. He also knew that Michael would behaving enough problems on his hands with the command of the fleet, so he would do his best to make sure that the Zentar would be battle-ready by the time the visiting officers were done. His voice rang over the intercom...
<br><br>"Make sure that you help the visiting officers with whatever they need, and continue what work you can on getting us battle ready. You have my faith and respect. May the Force be with us."
<br><br>Raul was in his uniform, instead of his Jedi robes, and as he stepped from his quarters, he was heading for the bridge of his ship...blaster and lightsaber as his side.

<p class="text">
Vice Admiral Darthboy is walkin down the corridor and enters a conference room filled with pilots.
<br><br>They all stand and salute.
<br><br>"At ease gentlemen, as most of you know the fleet is to soon deal a massive blow to the remnant forces lead by Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin. Now High Admiral Skywalker has already informed you of this plan I have a few things I want to discuss with you as pilots. Unfortunatly with all the officers on board Rear Admiral Jaknae is busy but I will relay the message to him later. I just want to try and explain something. It is well known that during the next battle lives will be lost, now I am here to make sure that none of those lives are yours. Darji and Jae, as sqaudron commanders I'm expecting you to use your experience to benifit the other pilots. Coordinate the squads and make sure not one ship is out of your sight or without instruction. If I can I will join you myself out there but I'll let you know later about that. I just want you to know, this is your day! Your life! Do not be foolish and over heroic. Listening to your commander and obeying orders is as heroic as you can be. Battles are won and lost as one fleet! one team! one family! Not by individuals. Be cautious, let the force guide you, keep your witts about you and most of all be proud to be a part of your squad, this ship the Zentar, the battlegroup and the fleet. Be proud of what your fighting for. Nothing worth having in life comes easy! Pride is worth having! Pride in what you do and how you do it, don't forget that when your out there.
May the Force be with you all
<br><br>Darthboy leaves to head back to the bridge to inform Rear admiral Jaknae.

Michael was meditating in a small room on the Corellian Corvette Zerulon, one of the escort ships of the convoi that was bringing tankers to the refuel station at Sara Sepentis Delta. He would meet the 5th fleet there. So he had some time to think on the comming mission. Time he would have usually spent with the other command officers of the fleet to discuss details of the plan. There were aspects of the situation he wasn't sure about. Horus forces were falling back to easily compared to the situation half a year ago. Well, time would solve this puzzle...

In the Main hanger bay of the ASD Prometheus Mike jumped down from the top starboard wing of his personal X-wing.Mike just finish fixing the top starboard engine when he saw his squadron commanders of Kappa,Lambda,MU,NU, and Omega walking in the hanger bay and towards him.Thats why he jumped down from the X-wing's top starboard wing so he can talk to them with out any yelling.Which in his favor there wasn't much noise going on in the main hanger bay.
<br><br>"Good even,men." Mike spoke up as the Squadron Commanders circle him.
<br>"Evening,sir!"They all reply at once after Omega Squadron Leader closed the circle.
<br><br>"First things first..At ease..Some of you already know we about to deal a massive blow to the remnant forces lead by Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin.Which I don't have to repeat what High Admiral Skywalker had debrief us on a secured communications with all ships of the fleet..So with that as a follow pilot I won't be on the Bridge giving out orders to you all..No my friend eventho I'm your Wing Commander I'll be flying along with you guys in my TIE Interceptor advance..You know your rolls your all are season pilots of Battlegroup One onboard its Flagship..You have dealt with other Imperial Remnant forces just like Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin..Do not be foolish and over heroic..Give out the right commands to your squads..They will be depend on you to survive this battle..Even they don't make it along with you..Remember this you gave your lives for this fleet and the Republic.Be proud of what your fighting for.!Thats all for now.May the force be with you....Get your squads together and get ready for combat..Dismissed!"
<br><br>With the final words Mike watch squadron commanders of Kappa,Lambda,MU,NU, and Omega fall out and fail out of the hanger bay.So they can get their squadrons together and be ready for combat.

Having gotten back from a training session a bit late, Aleksandr hit the comm switch and pulled up all his messages. Finding one from Mike, he read it quickly and then sent a hasty communique to Mike to find out how he could help.

<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Aleksandr</p>

<p class="text">
While heading out of the main hanger bay of ASD Prometheus  Mike heard his comlink beeped..So he check the com message which was from his former Squadron mate from Auric Squadron.Who is now its new squadron commander.Mike read the message and sent his reply back to Alex letting him to just keep the squadron togetheir during the battle with Horus' forces.After Mike sent that reply he made his way to his quarters to work through the daily pile of paperwork of supplies for his fighter wing.

Debarking from the Lambda-class shuttle, Lieutenant Commander James Ory smiles a bit as he looks around the hanger bay of the VNSD Predator.
<br><br>"It was a nice shore leave but I think I took too much time off...I wonder how my fighter wing is doing." He says to himself with some disdain. Only one thing concerns him, his flight group. Flight Group III of Auric Squadron was lead by the Lt. Commander and he was proud of his pilots that flew with him. He trusted them with his life, but there was one person he wanted to get back into contact with. After exiting the hanger he contacts Mike Skywaler.
<br><br>"Hotshot? Hello? I heard you moved to another ship...AND you got a promotion! Congrats, it's amazing the Aurics held together without you. So what's going on? The ship's crew is in a frenzy."

"Hotshot? Hello? I heard you moved to another ship...AND you got a promotion! Congrats, it's amazing the Aurics held together without you. So what's going on? The ship's crew is in a frenzy."
<br><br>Mike heard this on his comlink while he was doing to some paperwork in his quarters.So he picked up his comlink and repsonded to his old friend and comrade.
<br><br>"Hello Darklink nice to heard from you again..Yes thats right I'm onboard the ASD Prometheus as it third Wing Commander and thanks my friend..Yes its is amazing that Auric squadron is holding togetheir with out me..I know why to...Your new Squadron Commander Lieutenant Commander Aleksandr aka PokerBrat is following my lead and my leadership that I was doing when I was the Squadron Commander of Auric Squadron...I'm not doing much just doing some boring paper work for my fighter wing before the battle beings with Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin forces for the final time..Which you being a vetern of the Auric squadron you should know what to do with out the briefing.Because last I check that how you run Darklink which that what I like about you..You always figure out whats going on and what to do before a battle begins with any Imperial Remnant force..Why you say that the ship crew of the Predator is in a frenzy,Darklink?Last I check Commodore Thes Nazud was running the boat with good order."
<br><br>Mike took a breath and waits for Darklinks answer. 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</p>

<p class="text">
"...Darklink?Last I check Commodore Thes Nazud was running the boat with good order." The Lt. Commander smiles and responds, "Yes, they're not running around like a womprat with their heads cutoff, but there is a commotion and I'm assuming because of the upcoming campaign that's approaching. I can't wait to scrap some TIEs, I need more TIE Fighters on my helmet."
<br><br>Cutting the comm off, he looks at his helmet as he walks over to his X-Wing, the top of his helmet has a multitude of fighters and a couple of cruisers painted onto his pilot's helmet.
<br><br>Rebooting the commlink, James contacts Lt. Commander Aleksandr. "PokerBrat? Lt. Commander Ory reporting for duty. I just left my shore leave and I'm ready for some action. I hear you replaced Hotshot as squadron commander of the Aurics and I'm wondering if you have any room for a veteran ready to go back into the field?"

Raul had arrived at the bridge of his ship, the BB Zentar, after having stopped to get an operational status report on the ship and crew of his charge. Seeing everything was proceeding as planned, he decided to get onto the bridge, and get a few last-minute details handled. The lift door opened, and an ensign hollared out crisply...
<br><br>"Admiral on Deck!"
<br><br>Raul chuckled a little at that, and shook his head before his voice rang out crisply...
<br><br>"At ease gentlemen. As you were."
<br><br>Raul Jaknae began to make his way towards the captain's chair, and he sat down in it. Several ensigns walked over to him, holding datapads in their hands, and passing them over to the Admiral. The final status reports, missle loads, torpedo assignments, and the like...everything he would have to look over before they left port, and got underway. He calmly took each in turn, checking them over, and as he looked at the report pertaining to their armor status. He shook his head slightly, and he spoke...
<br><br>"We can't wait any longer on that...it will have to be fixed in hyperspace, as best as we can. Vamp up the shield generators in that section as well...offer us a little more protection just in case. Go now."
<br><br>The ensign took off towards the aft section, to the crew chief there, to do as ordered. He was looking over another set of datapads as he could feel the BB Zentar begin to move out, approaching the hyperspace jump point.

<br><br>Those were the last words Mike heard from Lt. Commander Ory because he knew that Ory turn off his comlink.Which Mike didn't mind this one bit he things to do before the hole Fifth Fleet heads off to Zarathos to finish off Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin Imperial Remnant forces.

Getting a text reply on his data pad, James reads that the fleet is heading into the Zarathos system to take down another Remnant warlord. "Excellent, time to scrap some eyeballs." He mutters to himself as he approaches his quarters to set his supplies, get changed into a clean flight jumpsuit and head towards the flight simulator to log some hours of training in before the big fight.

Michael's ship had meanwhile reached Sara Sepentis Delta and the corvette he was on had started the docking procedures with the ISD Hamburg XII. When Michael left the corvette's exit and entering the firsat section of the stardestroyer his brother Benjamin was already waiting there with block of soldiers in grey uniforms.
<br><br>"You have the connection with the fleet established, Benjamin?"
<br><br>"Sorry Michael, we have troubles getting a secured connection."
<br><br>"Reason?"
<br><br>"Unknown till now. Maybe they got our algorith decoded or they are just fooling us."
<br><br>"Ok, I need a Holonet connection to Commy then, voice only."
<br><br>A bit later in a conference room on the Zentar.
<br><br>"Everything ready for the party, Uncle Jack." Michaels voice talked through the loudspeakers.
<br><br>"Almost," High Admiral Corran Skywalker replied "But I will have everything prepared for the birthday we I meet you tomorrow."
<br><br>The High Admiral turned to the other officers in the room:
<br><br>"Ok, time to get things running."

After getting the paper done for the supplies for his fighters Rear Admiral Skywaler decided to head to the flight simulator to log some hours of training in before the big fight.Which Mike has always does this just to kill time before the flight simulators get turn off before a battle with Imperial Remnant forces like Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin.Some hours later and completing fours hours in the flight simulator when felt the uneased crew members and pilots through out the Prometheus.Mike understood why becuase some odd reason he felt uneased about this up coming battle with Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin and his last stand at Zarathos.Then Mike just told himself that everything will be alright and everyone will pull through.With that Mike head out of the flight simulator and head to the main hanger bay to do one last check on his X-wing and TIE Interceptor advance make sure they were in ship shape.

Everyone had gone off to do their own thing like they always did. Usually at this point he would be jumping into the fray, swinging his lightsaber around like a young gun, but things were different now. He wasn't as young as he once was and the job was getting to him. He was more of an administrator than an officer. He was sure even his padawan Keiran felt it when it came to his training.
<br><br>It didn't help that his condition was worsening, even though nobody else knew it, he was dying. He didn't suspect it would be long until the illness succumbed him. No need to let them know, he'd tough it out and go out in a blaze of glory most likely.
<br><br>He refocused to the task at hand. Horus was the target. He recalled the battles during the third Outer Rim War that they had with the Warlord. Many people were killed from not just the 5th Fleet, but from Rebel Squadrons as well. Soon, it'd all be over, one way or another, and whether or not Wolverine was there to see the next battle, they'd all move on, they had to, such as the way of things...
