<h1>Chapter I "Battle at Oberon"</h1>

<p class="text">
Rear Admiral Mattyboy was standing in the Briefing room in front of
the hologenerator that showed several red and green ship icons. In the
last minutes around 50 pilots arrived and filled the seats behind the Rear
Admiral. "In about 30 hours we'll do an assault on 3 objects. The first
two objects are depots, more than 20 transports and containers each depot.
We expect not more than two squadrons older fighters guarding them, Green
squadron will take out theese escorted by a squadron of X-Wings from the
Liberty. The last target is the main one. It's an Imperial starfortress
and any Imperial ship close to the fortress. We expect three stardestroyers
areound the base and a starfighter contingent of more then 300 fighters
on the fortress and the ships. Several bomber-squadrons will be eqipped
with heavy bombs, they have to drop them clos to the fortress and the stardestroyers.
To enable a free flight for them a first wave of X-Wings will do a torpedo
run on thge fortress and they will go into combat with enemy fighters close
to the fortress. We have enabled a trainingssimulation for this missions
in the trainings room, so I expect everyone of you there in half a hour.
Dismissed"
<br>Captain Ocato's shuttle arrived on the Doogltarr, an old droid controll
ship the Grand Admiral bought 2 month ago together with an division of
oudated battledroids. The batlledroids and two infantry divisions from
Battlegroup I would attack the Imperial forifications down on the planet.
Especially planetary defense weapons, hangars and radar stations were their
targets. Ocato noticed that Commander Devrin was still checking his blaster:
"Still nervous, Devrin?" "Have a bad feeling about this mission, sir. We
have too many asigned targets and the Imps have too many troops on the
planet." "We're just doing what we can. If we can hold 50% of the asigned
targets till the reinforcements come, it would be a good result."
<br>"Captain Perja, ma'am." a Lieutenant cried about a crowded floor. The
entire VSD Star Shatterer was busy repairing the damages of the battle
five days ago. "Ma'am, we still didn't got the new TIE Fighter Epsilon
version. It seems the convoi ran into two Imperium Class Stardestroyers
of Grand Admiral Ronin's expedition forces." "We still have two squadrons
of the TIE Fighter Gamma version on the Freighter Ontares, On did the freighter
already brought them to fefitting?" "The Freighter should be still here,
ma'am, but the Gamma's don't have shields, would be a suicid mission to
fight with this outdated ships." "You're right, but there should be enough
shield generators around, when I see all this wrecks of X-Wings and Y-Wings
and the TIE Series out there. Or take the shield generators of the ships
we can't repair. The Battegroup Hunter and especially it's fighter-squadrons
need to be 80% operational within 24 hours."
<br>One of the conference rooms of the ASD Prometheus, Grand Admiral Simon,
High Admiral Commskywalker, High Admiral Worf, Admiral Aino and a couple
of other 5th fleet command officers were sitting around a bigger holoprojection
of the close area with icons of Republican and Imperial ships on it. "TAC
and the local command have the same oppinion about the current situation.
The general assault tomorrow should weaken the Imperial forces strong enough,
to be able to blockade their support routes, actually they are still strong
enough to defend the route. When the Imperial fleets are isolated from
their support routes, they will sooner or later have to leave the system
and return to Imperial space." "Mike, the Imperial forces in the system
are much stronger then expected, I don't think we'll win as easy as the
command thinks." "I know Tommy, newertheless, the assault is nessesary.
The Imperial fleets haven't replaced their losses they got in the other
system till now, but they will soon, if we let them. And we're running
out of time. The High Command retransferred us to the core systems. In
3 weeks we have to be in Delasol again, if we won or not."

Captain Per-Corell was hanging off the side of her Xwing when a
tech ran back, and looked for her, not seeing her.
<br>"Ma'am? Can I have a word? Are you there?" She let some rope down and
dangled down like a spider nearly on top of the poor tech, who let out
a shriek.
<br>"Yes?"
<br>"Sorry, ma'am, didn't see you. We are still one shield generator short
of a full squadron for the coming battle and you requested the fighting
squadrons to be..." Perja didn't let the tech finish and handed him a small
box.
<br>"This is my XWing shield generator. Put it on the last fighter."
<br>"But ma'am...aren't you going to need it?" She grined.
<br>"No. Now get going before I execute you for bothering me." The tech
saluted and ran off.
<br>Her comlink sounded for the second time that day and she unhooked herself,
sumersaluting to the deck below. The caller ID said it was from the StarShatter
bridge. She frowned and headed off to the nearest turbolift.
<br>On the bridge, the tactical officer showed her the latest scan of the
system. Her blood ran cold as several enemy Star Destroyers showed up on
the scope.
<br>"Inform High Admiral Worf immedaitely. We would not survive another
full blown attack. Then move to the other side of the system, full cloaking."
<br>"But, madam, you don't have the clearance to..."
<br>"Listen, either you move the ship and hide it, or they will find us
and kill us. Now, I just spent three days repairing so move it, or I'll
make you." She let the threat hang in the air as she departed, pretty sure
that the StarShatter would be moving any minute now.
<br>Finally, after another 12 hours spent repairing, Perja went back to
her quarters to get prepared for her mission...infiltrating the
<br>last planet and bringing the shield generators down. She recorded some
messages for her family and friends, just in case she didn't make it back.
<br>Finally, she set off for the hangar bay where her trusted YT-1300 waited
to take her on her mission.
<br>Now, all she was waiting for was the go ahead from her Commander, who
would be back from his meeting shortly.

Rad walked down the ramp of the Gargoyle, his personal YT-2000,
after landing aboard the BB Zentar. Techs and pilots were running around
working on fighters and bombers. "Well, I know we were nearing the end
of this war, but it looks like Mike planned something big while I was gone."
He hurried to his office, put some of his junk away, and checked his mail.
"Junk, junk, junk, jun- oh wait, a letter from Zeratul. I'll check that
later. Junk junk, ah, yes. That's what I'm lookin for." He opened up a
piece of mail and read aloud quikly, "Rad, welcome back. Mike's planned
somethin big and I need to talk to you about it. Come see me A.S.A.P. -Tommy.
I'll see him after I rest."
<br>He opened his eyes to his R2 unit whinning and hooting. "What's up,
Ace?" The driod pulled Rad's tunic with his claw. "Okay, okay, I'm coming!"
The driod led him strait to Tommy's office. "Hey Tommy, what's up?"
<br>"Oh, hey Rad, listen, Mike wants us to take out three targets. Bomb
two depots and torp a starfortress. I think it's sursice, but-"
<br>"Say no more. Give me a list how many pilots we got, how many ships
we can use from each squadron, and the specifics on the targets. Send them
to me within two hours and I'll have an attack planned by tomorrow morning."
<br>"Sure thing."
<br>Hey, tech! Get over here" A tech ran over from an A-Wing to Rad and
his X-Wing immediatly.
<br>"Yes sir?" He saluted. Rad gave a casual salute. "I'm trusting you
personally to fix up my fighter to tip top shape. I'll also need you to
report to the head tech and give him this." He gave the tech a list. "Tell
him the Captain Greystone needs these orders carried out immediatly." The
tech looked at the list, saluted, then hurrried off.
<br>"Oh boy, we are gonna have a time," Rad said as he looked at the lists.
"Thanks," he said to the delivery boy, "I'll call for you when I need you.
Dismissed." rad turned to the lists, looked at the holo of his family,
looked at the lists again, and set them down. Rad started thinking of the
past week and his 'quest', then the past year and his training as a Jedi,
then to his past life. He looked down to his belt and saw his lightsaber
there, then looked to his closet and saw his jumpsuit and helmet there.
"Life used to be so easy."

After giving Rad a quick and watching him leave, CommSkywalker stretched,
tired from the many hours of gathering data. Having all the trust possible
in Rad, he knew they could pull the mission off. Yet a part of him, a part
from his younger days, wanted so badly for him to fly this mission, with
such high risks.
<br>He decided he would, and opened a comm channel to High Command, about
to inform them that he would be flying, when his personal comm link went
off. Closing the connection to the High Command, he checked his own comm.
It was a message being sent from Commander Jiko. No details were given,
but there was a problem back at the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4.
<br>Having no real choice, CommSkywalker had to leave for Yavin. He had
a tech officer inform the HC of his whereabouts, and left for Yavin, unsure
of how long he would be away..

<h1>Chapter II "Admirals are missing"</h1>

<p class="text">
Grand Admiral Simon's shuttle was on the way to the BB Zentar. The Imperials
had much more warships then expected; so another bomber attack had to be
organized quickly. "Arial, you're sure, the CRS Sancenna has been destroyed
by combined forces of Ronin and Larsen." "Seems so, Mike, a couple of survivors
reported that." "Didn't thought they would cooperate. I have a bad feeling
about this. We have too many warships without suplies and reinforcements
in this system." Suddenly Michael was looking back onto the radar, 3 red
points suddenly appeared. "Lieutenant Strack, you seen them." the Grand
Admiral sended to the 3 escoting TIE Fighters of Alpha squadron. "Yes admiral.
We'll take them out." Michael was triing to identify the fighters "Wait,
this are TIE Defenders ..."
<br>Captain Ocato's marines were walking over the main street of Goronian,
they just liberated from Imperial forces checking positions where to fortify
best. "Captain Ocato, sir" Lieutenant Evron were running over the place
with the long range communication system on his backpack. "Sir, Admiral
Worf want's to speak to you." Ocato was heading to the communicator "Admiral?"
"Ocato, take your man and return to the collecting points. It seems the
Imperials will win the superiority in space around the planet..." it was
quite for a bit, then the Admiral said "Ocato fast, turn the radio on"
In less then 2 minutes a radio was found and turned on. "This is INN, reporting
from the battle at Oberon. Imperial forces under the command of Grand Admiral
Ronin had a major victory in the Oberon system against the Rebel Alliance.
It seems the Rebels lost at lest 2 major cruisers, 15 smaller ships and
7 entire starfighter squadrons. And another good info from Oberon just
arrived. One of our heroical squadrons have shot down Grand Admiral junior
grade Michael Simon's shuttle. He and Admiral May have been arrested after
the shuttle crashed Theseus, the 3rd planet of Oberon system. Admiral Simon
seems to be one of the Rebellion's major military commanders in the Cadrel
Expanse.Intel will soon know more about strengh and tactics of the Rebel
forces in Cadrel..." "Captain, the Imperials don't have a save corridor
to more Simon away from Theseus, so he has to be still in the main garrison
not far away from you. you're new order is, your unit has to free Admiral
Simon and Admiral May and bring them to the next collecting point. We'll
start an air attack against the base to cover you, when you're entering
the garrison." "Affirmative sir, we'll get the Admiral out of there. Ocato
out."

Perja landed on Theseus not long after sunset. She registered on
planet as a trader, here for the annual fair. Some stormtroopers and guards
walked by her ship as she descended the ramp. They seemed restless, so
she assumed that there was trouble ahead. A secret transmission beamed
to the StarShatter has revealed that GA Simon had been captured by Imperials
and brought here.
<br>Her datapad sounded and she opened it to discover the lastest from INN.
<br>"Today, the capture of Rebels Grand Admiral Simon and Admiral May has
announced the impending victory of the Empire. Thought Intelligence has
not yet uncovered any connection, we believe that Alliance operatives may
be at large on the planet. All forces are to remain alert."
<br>Perja gulped. Captain Octato and his team were on the planet, attempting
rescue as well. But there was no way she could warn them without endangering
them...then she remembered something. Ocato was a Jedi. She retreated to
her ship and sat down in meditation.
<br>Her mind opened itself to the Force and she felt some familiar presences
on the planet. Quickly she tuned them out and pinpointed Octato.
<br>"Octato, you are in danger...Hear me, the Imps know that you are here.
Be wary." Perja felt his mind jump back in surprise then listen. The reply
floated in her mind. "Thanks Perj. We will be."
<br>A few moments later, she emerged from the YT-1300. The Imperial Garrison
was not far away from the spaceport and she set out on foot. More and more
stormtroopers were out and about. Perja frowned and slid her lightsaber
under her jacket. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to havent taken it with
her. All it was going to do was give her out as a Jedi.
<br>An Imperial Lieutenant walked past her. She waved her hand and he was
stopped in mid-stride.
<br>"You will tell me when Grand Admiral Simon is held."
<br>"Grand Admiral Simon is in the interrogation chambers." She waved her
hand again and the young man crumpled to the floor, unconscious, but alive.
<br>She sneaked closer to the base and stopped in observation. Guards were
on alert for an Alliance strike team. Maybe they would oversee a single
person. Perja walked to the guards.
<br>"I have some information for Admiral Porteous." she said. The Guard
demanded to see her ID. A fake came out of her pocket and was handed to
the guard.
<br>"Anellia Tharen?" she nodded. "I will inform the Admiral that you are
here."
<br>"That will not be necessary" she whispered as her hand struck the guard's
throat. He slumped in his seat. Perja walked on undisturbed.
<br>Suddenly, the air was blazing with lasers and torpedoes. The attack
on the base had started.

Coming out of hyperspace a bit early, CommSkywalker gave a slight
yawn. An unexpected trip to Yavin turned out to be nothing serious at all.
While practicing to feel the Force around them, one of the students altered
the ground right next to one of the Great Temples, causing it to actualy
start to sink. Finding it a bit amusing, he told the students that they
could also do the reverse, change the ground back to the way it was. After
seeing them do so, and talking a bit with each student, he left to return
to the fight against the Empire.
<br>As soon as he came into open space, he received a transmission. It
was a message sent from Worf, informing him about Mike. Upon hearing it,
he immdediately went to off to Mike. Just outside the planet, he closed
his eyes and opened himself up, feeling the Force. He senses Perja trying
to communicate with Ocato..but she is farther away. Heading east towards
Ocato, he wonders if somehow, had he been here, would Mike still have been
caught..?

Perja ran to the nearest entrance and opened the door. Pilots were
running to their ships in the main hangar. Perja ran in the opposite dirsction
when a hand spun her around. In front of her was Tav.
<br>"I would recognize you anywhere, Perja. What are you doing in the base?"
<br>"I happen to be doing my job." Her hand went to her blaster. "Don't
make me kill you."
<br>"So am I."
<br>Tav's hand dropped to his blaster, but too slowly. Perja's blaster
had already spat a blue coil that dropped Tav to the floor, a stunned -litterally-
expression on his face. Perja dragged his unconscious form to a closet
and stuffed him inside.
<br>"Man, you really need to keep off those IO burgers, Tav..." she thought
as she closed the cupboard on him.
<br>Perja ran on deeper into the base.
<br>In a dark corridor, at sublevel 12, she sensed something. She stopped
and extended her senses. Readiness, but no agression...Yet. She took a
few careful steps forward, when her danger sense flared. In a flash, he
lightsaber was in her hand and she parried a blow...from Tommy.
<br>"Comm! Stop, it's me, Perja." she shouted. The pressure against her
blade stopped and she looked in the silvery light from her saber at Comm.
"What are you doing here? I thought you were on Yavin IV."
<br>"I came back. Mike is captive."
<br>"Who isn't here for him?" she smiled. "Well, the air bound attack has
started. Might as well find him now."
<br>Comm nodded slowly and they set off down the corridors. They found
Octato's strike team after some time.
<br>"Any luck on finding Mike yet? " Comm asked. Octato shook his head.
Perja frowned.
<br>"We don't have time for this! Let's get to it."
<br>"Have a better idea, Miss Know-it-all?" Comm spat out.
<br>"Actually, yes!" she countered, igniting her lightsaber again. He took
a step back as she slashed throught the wall behind him. But it had not
been an attack. A neat hole was pierced in the wall and it revealed a holding
cell. Grand Admiral Simon was seated there alone, looking weary.
<br>"Howdy, Supreme Commander...Have you ordered a rescue team recently?"
<br>Another explosion shook the building.
<br>Octato winced. "Let's get out of here before Worf brings the building
down on us!"
<br>Grand Admiral Simon shook his head.
<br>"No, we have to find Admiral May first."

Commodore Darth Boy was in the liberty thinking about the plans they
discussed in the ASD Prometheus earlier and thought what he should do.
He thought then he thought of something. Darth Boy ran over to the Communications
and called his Good friend Perja. He called her and she answered a I asked
her "Perja I'm not sure which squad to send first gold or rogue because
I need one to escort the ship which would be better to guard the ship x-wings
or a-wings and which would be better for attack"
<br>"I think you should use a-wings as defense and B-wings as backups ,you
forgot about the green squad didn't you, and then use the x-wings as attackers"
<br>"thanks Perja see you after the battle, I hope"
<br>Darth Boy launched the x-wings kept the B-wings engines running and
sent half of gold squad out to guard the ship. He said to CPT Podge "we
may have to get into our own a-wings but we must stick together never get
out of each others sight ok" and with that they sat in their chair waiting
for the signal from Simon. Darth Boy called all the captains of the ships
to wish them luck and then turns to the window and waits....

Just as he is about to decend towards the planet, CommSkywalker
checks the beep coming from his radar. An enemy fighter was on his tail,
and he wouldn't be able to land as long as it stayed that way. Tightening
speed and pulling to his port, he went for a loop, just as the enemy pilot
opened up a comm channel to him. "Rebel pilot, you are not allowed to enter
this planet. I am giving you one chance to leave". Comm gasped quickly,
then grinned, replying "Captain Syndic, are you sure about that?", and
pulling his right wing up a bit as a laser shot passed. "Tommy! Oh boy
have I been waiting for this, your going down". Glancing at his radar,
Comm swithced his power full to engines and started towards the planet
"Well Syndic, instead of dealing with me, you may want to take care of
that fleet that Worf is sending behind you. Take care.." Comm laughed as
Syndic mumbled a few curses towards him, while breaking off his attack
to flee from Worf's forces. After giving Worf a quick thanks, Comm finally
made his way towards the planet surface, but couldn't locate either Perja
or Ocato, his apprentice. Looking for a spot to land, he noticed Perja's
YT-1300 lying about, and landed a few meters from there. To his surprise,
the area was pretty much empty, due mostly in part to the space battling
up ahead, he thought. Comm shortly entered the Imperial building, blaster
out, lightsaber still tucked in. He got to a corner, and sensed Perja nearby.
A quick glimpse around the corner, and he saw 2 imps, not going for him,
but for Perja, he immediately fired at one of them. The other whipped out
his blaster, but was already hit in the chest by the time he was ready
to fire. He was knocked back, but fired off one shot behind him.
<br>Another blast almost knocked everyone to their feet. "Worf really IS
trying to bring this place down on top of us!" "Yea Ocato, we kinda noticed
that" Helping Mike to his feet, Perja noticed that he had been drugged,
"You guys, there is no way he can walk outta here on his own", only for
Comm to snap a quick reply 'Another genius we have here". Perja and Comm
almost got into one of there famous arguments when Ocato stopped them.
"Now sure as hell aint the time, here's what we will do. My men will go
out the normal way back to their shuttle, distracting any Imperials. We
will take Mike out on our own, back to Perja's ship, there is nothing we
can do for Admiral May right now, it must wait" Giving quick nods to each
other, Comm went towards Ocato and put Mike around his shoulder, Ocato
doing the same on the otherside. Perja put her saber in front her, leading
the way. As they started to move out, Comm made a quick look towards Ocato,
"You know, you aren't our mother.." Ocato said nothing and coninued on.
Only running into one officer, Perja put away her saber, and pushed him
up against the wall, her hands on her neck. "What do you know about Admiral
May?" Shaking, he replied that he didnt know anything. "Don't lie to me,
otherwise your coming with us, and one night with Comm will make you a
totally changed man!" Upon hearing that, he quickly said to Perja that
they had already taken Admiral May out, and were going to bring her in
a week to the Oberon System.
<br>After letting him go, Perja, Ocato, Mike and Comm finally made it out
of the Imperial building. Going as fast as they could, which wasnt really
fast at all, since Comm and Ocato were carrying Mike, they finally made
it to the ship. Perja immediately got on board, powering it up. After helping
to plac Mike in the back of the ship, Comm gave a quick salute to him and
Ocato, then ran towards the ship's exit. Just before leaving the ship,
Comm yelled out to Perja in the cockpit "For Mike's sake I hope you dont
handle this ship like you handle Worf!" Without waiting to hear her response,
he ran towards his XJ-Wing, only several meters away. Hopping into the
cockpit, he opened up a channel to Perja. He immediately heard her snicker,
"We'll 'discuss' later what you just yelled out to me, for now we need
to make sure Mike gets outta here, flyboy". Comm quickly made sure all
systems were working "You don't need to tell me twice, star-" Wondering
why Perja closed the calm, he shrugged and kicked in his repulsors, lifting
him up. He noticed Perja's ship doing the same, but waited until she started
to leave, before his gave full power to his engines, and started to leave
the planet behind her.

</p>
<p class="author" align="right">High Admiral Commskywalker</p>
<p class="text">

Perja sneered at Comm's reply, a standard one that always made her
blood boil. She opened her mouth to scorch the channel when Octato slapped
the communit shut. She looked at him.
<br>"You can bicker later! Now get this...bucket of bolts off the ground."
<br>"This is not a bucket of bolts!"
<br>"Whatever, just take off, girl." She complied and the Cloud Wanderer
lifted off gracefully.
<br>The atmosphere was soon left behind by the somewhat pwerful engines
of the Cloud Whisperer. Everything seemed fine until the warning tones
went off on all the control panels. A message flashed across her control
panel: "Ha, got you Perjy. Sanchez." She blanched with rage.
<br>"Why that stupid...!" Octato put a restraining hand on her arm.
<br>"Calm yourself, focus." She took a deep breath and sat at the controls
once again. The hyperdrive was out of whack, as were the shields. "Give
me a readout of the sitch, Perja." Octato said in that calm voice of his.
"We can get my team to help, their ship is up there. And Comm is there
too."
<br>"No engines, sublight or hyperdrive, no shields, no weapons system,
no comm unit."
<br>Perja took a deep breath and let her anger flow through her. But the
power it gave her allowed her to feel the presence of Worf on his ship.
She reached out to him. Relief floated back to her in the Force and the
promise that he would come and get her.
<br>Perja went to check on Mike, who was still totally dazed in the cabin,
praying that Worf would fast enough, as Stardestroyers loomed ahead.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>"What! They're both gone!" Rad screamed aloud as he left Admiral May's
cell.
<br>He'd already found Mike's with a big hole in it.
<br>"Best get out of here quick."
<br>Rad ran as fast as he could toward where he'd hid his ship.
<br>"Trigg, fire-up the engines. We're gone as soon as I close the ramp."
<br>The ship blasted off the second the ramp was up. Rad, luckily,was holding
<br>onto the back of his pilot chair. He sat in it as soon as he got his
balance.
<br>"Ace, scan for any ships as large as a shuttle or a little bigger in
the immediate area."
<br>The droid hooted.
<br>"I think they took Admiral May out before Worf began his attacksince
I'm sure he wouldn't be leveling the building if
<br>May was still there. I'm assuming Perja and Comm got Mike."
<br>A few seconds later, the building blew up,and a minute later, Trigg
had ID locks on the
<br>Cloud Wanderer, Comm's XJ X-Wing, a Rebel shuttle identified as a stike
team, and an Imperial shuttle headingtowards the Star Destroyers above
the planet.
<br>"Well, everyone got out. Let's head after that Imp shuttle. More than
likely, Admiral May is on it."
<br>Trigg then started whining and screaming.
<br>"What? What's wrong?" He looked down at the radar. The Cloud Wanderer
was no longer there.
<br>"Oh no."
<br>The Gargoyle stopped a few meters in front of the Cloud Wanderer. Rad
tries
<br>the comm. system. Nothing came back. He saw Ocato and Perja in the
cockpit. He
<br>sensed Mike was with them.
<br>"No go, Ace. Comm system must be dead, just like
<br>everything else."
<br>Rad closed his eyes and focused with the Force.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Perja let Rad's mind drift away from hers. No, there was no way she
was leaving her ship be destroyed. It was the only link she had to her
past life.
<br>She unstrapped herself hastily and ran to Mike.
<br>"Mike! Wake up!" She shook the Admiral. He craked an eye open.
<br>"Perja, stop making so much noise...let me sleep...I need sleep."
<br>She sighed and called Octato.
<br>"We have to get him on the Gargoyle. Rad is out there, he can take
Mike back to the fleet." Octato nodded slowly.
<br>"But what about your ship?"
<br>"It will be destroyed." she said calmly. Octato nodded once again and
picked up Mike. Perja streched out with the Force once again and found
Rad fretting nearby.
<br>She felt his relief at her decision...well, he didn't know the rest
of her plan.
<br>Perja and Octato carried Mike to the ailock, as it opened towards the
Gargoyle. Rad was on the other side and helped Octato carry Mike inside.
Perja backed away into her ship.
<br>"Come on! Whatcha waiting for?" Rad shouted.
<br>Perja shook her head.
<br>"I'm not coming with you. You need time to make it back to the StarShatter.
My ship is going for destruction, with me at the controls."
<br>"Don't be stupid, woman, get your arse on board now."
<br>"I'm Corellian, Rad. We never let our ships be destroyed on their own."
She paused and raised her lightsaber in a formal salute as she closed the
airlock. "May the Force be with you." Immediately, she felt the minds of
her companions try to reason her.
<br>&lt; Come on starho, be reasonable...> Comm tried to say. She shut
her mind and walked back to the cockpit. She strapped herself once more
at the controls and accelerated to full speed away from the Gargoyle and
the XJ-Wing.
<br>Time was what they need. She would give them what they needed. The Cloud
Wanderer turned back to face the nearest incoming StarDestroyer, lasers
blazing. She accelerated more, shunting power from the shields to feed
the engines.
<br>On the Imperial StarDestroyer, the captain saw with worry the Corellian
YT-1300 accelerate towards them.
<br>"Don’t let this ship past! Capture it, it has the Rebel Admiral on
it! " He shouted.
<br>But the ship continued at a rapidly closing rate.
<br>"It’s going to ram us, Sir! " His lieutenant shouted from the pit.
"We have to take evasive before it is too late. "
<br>The Imperial Captain sneered. "No, destroy the ship. "
<br>Perja saw the ISD’s turbolasers rotating towards her ship. This was
it. There was no going back now. She felt fleetingly Worf trying to talk
her into taking evasive action. The Force boiled in her veins now, making
her more powerful than she had ever been. She unstrapped herself and ran
to the hold, locking the ship’s course. She climbed into her Xwing, which
was under a tarp. The turbolaser hits were making the ship shake. She cast
a lingering look at the Cloud Wanderer and sealed herself in the Xwing’s
cockpit, waiting for her moment.
<br>The YT-1300 sped towards its destiny, under the eyes of Worf, on the
StarShatter. He gritted his teeth as the turbolasers from the ISD tore
through the small ship. Perja was too stubborn for her own good, and this
time, he didn’t think she was going to make it. Suddenly, the Cloud Wanderer
exploded in a cloud of superheated metal.
<br>"Noooooooo!" He shouted, slamming his hand against the transparisteel.
But there was not the fell of death to that explosion. Just wild hope and
elation. He frowned slightly. "Scan the wreck for escape pods or life forms!"
A Lieutenant spoke quietly.
<br>" I doubt anyone survived that, Sir."
<br>Worf turned, his face transformed. "Scan the wreck." The Lieutenant
backed away and ran to his station.
<br>Perja’s ship finally exploded and her Xwing floated free of the rest
of the ship. She pushed the throttle full forward, speeding away as the
Cloud’s remains slammed into the bridge of the ISD.
<br>"Wohoo ! " she shouted. But her attention was now fully engaged on
escaping the Ties that were coming after her.
<br>The Fifth Fleet comm system was now alive with that Corellian war cry
as all ships regrouped for battle. Worf got the news that Comm had made
it back to his ship and that Simon was now on the StarShatter. He opened
a channel to Rad.
<br>"Are you going after Admiral May ? "
<br>"Yes"
<br>"Allright. May the Force be with you, Rad. "
<br>Perja opened her comlink.
<br>"Worf ? Come and get me, pleasee, there are some eyeballs I can’t shake
here…Ah, and no shields either…"
<br>She spread the Force as shielding, as a laser beam hit her ship.
<br>"Come on, someone, get me outta here !" she whispered.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>"Perja, can you hear me"
<br>"Rad? Good thing you’re a Corellian. Most people wouldn’t be able to
get past
<br>all the fighters alone"
<br>"No time for talk. I see two squadrons of TIEs on
<br>their way. Worf won’t make it in time. We have two options. You won’t
like
<br>one of them"
<br>"Tell me, you might surprise me"
<br>"Alright. First,we can wait here, let me try to bide enough time to
allow Worf to arrive"
<br>"Don’t think we’ll all survive"
<br>"Neither do I.Second is get everyone aboard the Gargoyle and sacrifice
the Cloud Wanderer"
<br>"No, no, no, no! I won’t do that"
<br>"It may be ouronly chance. It’s up to you, of course, but hurry up
and don’t get us allkilled"

Juking her ship to her left, Perja growled as her Force power drained
away, leaving her ship vulnerable to attack by the 8 TIE fighters trailing
her. Not willing to give up, Perja continued to fly as evasive as possible,
but even she knew she couldnt keep it up for more than anoter minute, as
one direct hit would render her ship useless. Just then, he radar beeped,
lighting up as 12 new dots appeared. Her radar soon indicated that they
were friends, not enemies. She sighed in relief as a squadron of B-Wings
rughed past her to engage the TIE's. Her comm crackled as she heard Comm
"This is two you owe me, sister" Perja was about to respond when she heard
another voice "Hey there Captain, this is Rear Admiral Mattyboy and Green
Squadron, at your service" Perja smiled some more "Matty, how in the name
of the reborn emporer did you get here?" Matty pulled his craft up, firing
two quick shots and eliminating a TIE "Simple, Comm had us waiting outside
the system in case we were quickly needed for something. He got back to
the Zentar and right away had us hyperjump in to your position and lend
a hand" Perja thanked Matty as she checked her power, and then frowned.
She would only be able to make it to the Zentar, so thats where she was
headed. Matty commed his squadmates, checking damage status. Only one fighter
was heavily damaged, but he was able to fly back to the Zentar. Matty smiled,
glad that he hadnt lost anyone..something which has happened too often
in his career.
<br>Several hours later, several other ships from the 5th Fleet arrived,
helping Worf and Comm to mop anything up. Shortly after, a meeting was
held on the Starshatter, where Mike was beginning to come back to being
himself.
<br>Worf was the first to speak up "If Admiral May hadn't been captured,
I would say this was a good day for us." "Yes, but the Admiral was captured,
meaning this wasn't a good day." "Yes, I know that Comm..anyway, we know
where they will be with the Admiral, and we need to make plans about that"
Perja chimed in, "Rad went off to find the Admiral..do you think he might
find her?" "Hard to say," said Ocato "He is only one person, and I don't
think they will be as careless with the Admiral this time as they were
earlier today. We know where they will be, and we have 5 days to prepare.
Not a whole lot of time, but its what we must do" Mike then stood up slowly,
still a bit drowsy from the drugs "Very well thought out, hopefully Rad
will be able to get some extra info, such as how big of a fleet they will
be bringing. Nevertheless, we must prepare now." Everyone nods to Mike,
as they all share the same feelings. "Worf, you go over the damage assessments
and get your group prepared. Tommy, same goes for you. Ocato, you need
to prepare your ground team. Matty and Perja, you need to get the word
out to all our officers, and inform them of how important this fight will
be" Mike gives a salute to his officers as they salute back, and go to
their duty. Mike smiled as he watched them leave, very proud of them..and
then lied down as he became dizzy again "This is gonna be a tough fight.."

<h1>Chapter III "The Search for Admiral May"</h1>

<p class="text">
It’d been thirteen long and hard days alone with Trigg, or Ace, which
was short for Trigger Ace. Rad had named the droid soon after their first
battle. Trigg had always been great at getting locks real quick. They’d
been after Admiral May ever since the rescue of Michael Simon. Rad had
gotten an I.D. of the shuttle he suspected carried May right before he
broke his pursuit to save his friends. By the time everyone was safe aboard
the BB Zentar, the shuttle had already gone into hyperspace. Rad had followed
its course to numerous planets. He finally caught up to it after searching
three systems. Unfortunately, they had already dropped the Admiral.
<br>“Where is she?! Where did you take her?!” Rad slammed the commander
up against the bulk again.
<br>“W- we left her on Thrazzz. That’s the last we saw of her.” Rad could
hear the fear in his voice. He dropped him to the ground, right next to
two of his officers.
<br>“Where did she go from there?”
<br>“I don’t know,” The man said cautiously. Rad pulled his blaster out
and pointed it at his head. The man’s eyes widened and he screamed, “I
don’t know!” The man began to cry and fell to the ground. Rad disappeared
like a ghost.
<br>Rad walked up to the officer on duty. “Excuse me, do you remember a
shuttle marked as Imperial coming in to this port at docking bay 12 about
two days ago? It had five passengers, three male, two female. One female
was probably bruised and battered.”
<br>“A lot of shuttles marked as Imperial com into this port daily,” The
man replied without looking at Rad. Rad pulled out a clip of credits and
waved it in front of the man’s face. The man sat up and looked at Rad as
he took the credits.
<br>“Yeah, I remember the shuttle. They came in at about midnight two days
ago. You’re right one woman was bruised. What about it?”
<br>“Track the bruised woman around the port.” The man did as he was told.
Rad watched the monitor until the Admiral had gone aboard a luxury cruiser.
“Where did that cruiser go?”
<br>The man checked something. “Records say it went toward the Nal Hutta.”
<br>Rad thought to himself, “Nal Hutta? Emperor’s black bones, why would
they take her there?” Rad ran out the door to the Gargoyle.
<br>“What a nasty little place they’ve picked out for her. I’m never gonna
find her.” Rad walked along the streets of Nal Hutta along with smugglers,
bounty hunters, gamblers, fortunetellers, and countless other beings. He’d
been there for four days already. First thing he’d done when he’d arrived
was lock down the Gargoyle. Second, he found that Admiral May had been
taken to the Corellian Sector. Rad asked and searched around most all of
the Corellian Sector. He was losing hope.
<br>“Watch it buddy!” A well-dressed man bumped into Rad and walked away.
Rad ignored it. He began thinking about where she could be again when a
memory flashed into his mind. The man had been one of the three with the
Admiral at Thrazzz. Rad spun around quickly and followed the man to a cantina.
He waited a minute to enter, then dove face first into Weequay as he entered.
“Hey, what do you think you’re doing buddy?”
<br>”Sorry about that. I really need a drink, can you let me through?”
<br>”Naw, I think you need to be taught a lesson.”
<br>”You really don’t want to do that.”
<br>“Oh sure I do.”
<br>It’d been thirteen long and hard days alone with Trigg, or Ace, which
was short for Trigger Ace. Rad had named the droid soon after their first

“Hey, what do you think you’re doing buddy?”
<br>”Sorry about that. I really need a drink, can you let me through?”
<br>”Naw, I think you need to be taught a lesson.”
<br>”You really don’t want to do that.”
<br>“Oh sure I do.”
<br>The weequay threw a fast and very hard punch strait to Rad’s face. Lucky
for Rad, he knew it was coming. He ducked before the punch was even thrown
and drove his right knee strait into the weequays gut. He immediately jumped
back to avoid a backhanded swing that would have knocked Rad out. Rad then
brought a right roundhouse into the weequays skull. The weequay then drew
a knife. Rad drew his blaster. As the weequay dove towards him, knife extended,
he jumped up with the help of the Force and blasted a hole right into the
back of the left knee of the weequay. Rad landed a meter away and ran into
the bar. He didn’t see the man anywhere, so he used the Force to find him.
A few second later, he found him behind a door in the back. Rad followed
the man into an ally that brought them to another door that led down into
a dark room where he felt, and defiantly smelt, Gamorreans nearby. He used
the Force to probe their minds to find the man he was searching for. Then
he found him. He was in a room full of life from all forms of species.
He quietly walked into the room with the Gamorreans and made them believe
they were tired. They soon fell asleep. He walked into the room with all
the life he sensed. What he found was a prison. He saw Twi’leks, he saw
Rodians, he saw Wookies, he even saw some creatures he didn’t even know
existed. He also saw some humans. After about twelve cells, he found a
woman. The woman was Admiral May.
<br>He made a door to the cell with his lightsaber. The Admiral was asleep.
Rad sat next to the Admiral and examined her for a minute. He guessed she
was drugged. “Admiral May, wake up.” He began to lightly shake her. “Come
on, Admiral, we have to get out of here.” He sensed someone coming seconds
before he heard a man’s voice.
<br>“My lord, I have brought her to you. I am sorry I didn’t bring the
man.” What Rad heard next was what shocked him the most. He heard a very
deep voice that spoke in Huttese. It was a Hutt. “I am pleased you brought
her, but I will not pay until I have the man.” Rad picked up the admiral
and ran out the door. He ran up the stairs he’d come out of and strait
to the Gargoyle. He didn’t care how many people saw him carrying the Admiral.
All he cared about was getting off Nal Hutta and back to the fleet.
<br>“Admiral Simon, I found her.” Rad was already on his way back to the
fleet with the Admiral in his cabin. She was still sleeping when Rad had
entered hyperspace. “She’s alright. She’ll feel pretty bad for a bit, but
she’ll be fine.”
<br>”Thank you, Rad. While you were gone, some of our Jedi have felt tremors
in the Force shortly before they were hit. The Shadow and the Hunter were
damaged pretty bad.”
<br>Rad sunk back into his chair. “Tell me more when we arrive. I need
to let this sink in.”
<br>”Sure, see you when you get here.” He gave Rad a salute that Rad returned.
The transmission ended.
<br>“What happened?” Admiral May appeared behind Rad. He stood and saluted.
<br>“Admiral, I’m Captain Rad Greystone. I’m with Grand Admiral Michael
Simon. I was sent to-” She saluted and cut him off.
<br>“I know you’re with Michael, I saw him on the screen. What happened?”
<br>“Well, you and him were-” She cut him off again.
<br>“No, I mean what happened with your fleet?”
<br>“Oh, well, I don’t exactly know. All I know is that two of our groups
were hit pretty bad. Both of them I am close to. The Shadow, though it’s
no longer mine, is the ship my family salvaged and rebuilt. The Hunter
is what I’m now in command of.”
<br>She looked to the ground as he stood and gave her a blanket. “Thank
you. I’m sorry about what happened.”
<br>”Me too.”
