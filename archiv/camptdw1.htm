<h1>The Dark Within (Part I)</h1>

<p class="text">
One of the Republican galaxy scanners accidently found an Imperial remnant fleet close to the border of the galaxy. The scan showed 2 ISDs 7 ships in the size of a dreadnaught and around 20 ships in the size of a corvette.
<br>One of the ISD IDs could be indentified. It's the Minotaurus, the stardestroyer belonged to Admiral Brackets battlegroup and was last seen in the battle of Eloria, two years past Endor. The other ID code couldn't be identified, looks like a newer one.
<br>There were also reports that units of the fallen were seen in the region.
<br>
<br>The mission will be the following. Before we can act against the Imperials Remnants in the regions two Republican targets need to be secured first.
<br>The first one is the Taragosh system. A yellow sun with two smaller planets and two gas giants. The second of the planets is the homeworld of the Taraids. They are looking pretty much like furballs with 4 small legs and the are members of the Republic, So it's nessesary to protect the planet from an possible Imperial invasion.
<br>The Taraids don't like ppl from other races landing on their planet, but they have a orbital platform they use for inter planetary trading. That platform could be used as operation base for the system defence. the ISD Hamburg XII and the ISD Immotal are already there to upgrade the weapon systems of the platform.
<br>The Republican Mining Cooperation (RMC) also has several mining opperation in the A-731 system. The system contains of a huge asteroid belt, two gas giants and a smaller rock like planet. So there are several minier ad automatic asteroid miners in the arsteroid belt, and there is a refuel station in the orbit of the small planet.
<br>There are around 5000 to 10000 civil personnel in the system. There need to be preperations made to evacuate the system. Sure the refuel station may have some tactical interest, but we should focus on the defense of Taragosh.
<br>
<br>BG Zentar will be asigned to Taragosh, BG Hunter to A-731

<i>Raul had heard of the impending threat to a system, far off the beaten paths, a remote system. he didn't really cotton to sticking their proverbial noses in the middle of what could become a subjudication...always brought out bad feelings, when one group trierd to impose their will on another...then a third party tried to impose -their- will on them...but, he was just a Lieutanant...and already had been in hot water once. So, he moved towards the squad room, to get his men ready for the upcoming fight.</i>

<i>Admiral Michael Simon and his brother Benjamin were walking through the corridors of the ISD Hamburg XII. Michael's shuttle had just arrived and Benjamin was introducing him into the situation.</i>
<br>
<br>"I guess the Immortal got damaged by in Imperial Mark 8 spybot, we catched the same modell on a shuttle that transported soldiers from the orbital platform. We were about to warn the Immortal on that spybots but the reactor on the Immortal shut down before."
<br>
<br>"How much damaged is the Immortal, Benni?"
<br>
<br>"The reactor core is irrepairable, need to be replaced. The reserve system produce enough power to keep life support, doors and lights online, but shield, engine and weapons are down. The tractor beams of the station hold the ship in it's orbital position."
<br>
<br>"Any radiation leaks."
<br>
<br>"Fortunatly not."
<br>
<br>"Well, Battlegroup Zentar should arrive here within a few hours and take over the system defense. That should give us enough time to get a new reactor core trasported here."

<br>
<br>This is the Captain speaking,
<br>
<br>When we get out of hyperspace, I want a squad of X-Wings to immediately launch out to patrol/defense, Don't know what we maybe entering, so, raise shields 100% after they launch and prepare for the worse, Starwind out.
<br>
<br><i>Sighing alittle bit, he didn't feel much out of the force...but, always wanting to keep cautious about these things, soon, hitting the edge of Taragosh</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Raul was making his way to the briefing room, when he heard Starwind's announcement. He had figured as much, and he thought he'd go ahead and take his squad on the mission. He flicked on his comlink, speaking into it...it was sent to the bridge, and Starwind in particular...</i>
<br>
<br>"Lieutenant Jaknae here...Flight one has the duty. I'll get the men prepped and we'll be on our way as soon as the lines fade. Jaknae out."
<br>
<br><i>Raul turned the corner as he flipped the comlink off, and tucked it into his pocket. Dressed in the orange and white flight suit of the Republic, his helmet under his free arm, he came to the briefing room, and keyed the door open. It would be a few minutes before the rest of his squad would arrive...and he already was formulating his strategy for deployment.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Intelligence. Without it, no course of action can be taken. All of the Star Destroyers in the Imperial Remnant could not attack the New Republic and hope to win if they had no knowledge of where to attack; and the entire New Republican Navy cannot patrol every system for Imperials. Intelligence is a necessity. And, as it is needed, so is Counter-Intelligence; for if a weakness in the Navy were to be discovered by the Empire, the tides of the war could be turned for the worse.
<br>
<br>It is the job of CI's Security division to maintain the loyalties of the Republic's fleets; with the cover of regular soldiers, they keep a watchful eye for Imperial spies. It is unknown for sure how many Security agents are in the New Republic, even by the Chief of Counter-Intel.
<br>
<br>Each Security agent, then, is alone, reporting to whoever they deem to be the most capable and trustworthy of the information. One such agent, unknown to his colleagues and superiors, is serving on the Immortal. Soniv Hope, Lt. Commander, Phi Squadron's Vice Squadron Leader.</i>
<br>
<br>"Blast these Star Destroyers, too finicky. Nothing like a TIE, or any starfighter for that matter." Soniv mused to himself as he began to work on one of the coolant pumps damaged by the spybot's attack. Sure, most of the Battlegroup might consider the Immortal's core irreparable, "But they were trained under the Empire. For a Rebel like me, anything can be repaired. Well, anything mechanical anyway." At the ensuing thoughts, Soniv began to work harder, and, though none could see him in the vacsuit, or perhaps because of it, anger splayed across his face.
<br>
<br><i>As Soniv finally calmed down, however, he completed repairing the coolant pump. He decided to radio the command crew to note his success.</i>
<br>
<br>"Technical to command, one coolant pump repaired. We should be able to give more power now. Not much, but enough to power a couple of turbolasers at least. I'll still need to work on the fuel chambers."
<br>
<br><i>The Immortal's commander responded to the signal.</i>
<br>
<br>"Any work is good work, Soniv. Keep it up, and we might be able to actually hold our own until reinforcements arrive."
<br>
<br>"Good. I'll repair the remaining pumps, then, and move on the the fuel intakes and control systems. Shouldn't take more than a few hours. Won't be as solid as a new core, but we'll function at least."
<br>
<br>"Good news. Report to us as the situation changes. Command out." With that, the comlink connection was cut off. With that, Soniv, making sure there were no active listeners nearby, decided to make his call to the local Security division he was assigned to.
<br>
<br>"Command, Security Agent Hope here. Through deduction of all transmissions sent through this ship, I can find no trace of any coded messages to the Empire, prior to or after the attack. They simply caught us with our jumpsuits down, at least on this level. I'm turning the investigation over to the upper levels. Hope out." Closing the transmission, Soniv moved onto the next coolant pump. This was going to be a long day...

<i>Captain Mattias Gustafsson positioned himself in the Predator's command chair. Admiral VDJ Karper was away, leaving Mattias the commanding officer aboard.</i>
<br>
<br>Prepare the ship for jump to hyperspace, we will reach the asteroid field first so I want Crimson to launch the minute we jump out of hyperspace, I want Beryl on stand-by. Look sharp everyone, I don't want to give the ship back in peices when the Admiral returns.
<br>
<br><i>The bridge personnel nodded and prepared the ship for hyperspace.</i>
<br>
<br>"Comm Officer, send word to HC that we are operational and should be arriving at the asteroid field rather quickly."
<br>
<br><i>Mattias leaned back in the chair and gave the order to jump into hyperspace when the preparations were made.</i>

<i>Commodore Gessinger just entered Grand Admiral Simon's office.</i>
<br>
<br>"Mike, this can go on this way. We found two more of my soldiers killed. So we lost 5 security officers in 2 days on that platform."
<br>
<br>"Well, you can ask Rene for additional security personnel from the Immortal."
<br>
<br>"I will do that, but that's not the point. I don't think it's safe enough for the meeting of all the ship captains and command officers. Can't we do the meeting on the Hamburg?"
<br>
<br>"We need to make the meeting on the platform to show the senat and the Taraidian government that we have the situation under control. We have an infantry division on the Hamburg, and another on on the Immortal. It should be possible to secure the platform. You can request all resourses you need to."

<br>
<br>Officer: Captain, we're pulling out of hyperspace in Asteroid Field A-731, Crimson reports ready to launch and all systems are operational.
<br>
<br>Mattias: Very good, take us out of hyperspace, hail the fuel station and prepare my shuttle for transport. Maintain fighters on patrol on all times. At least until The Angel of Death arrives, or Payback. Then coordinate defenses with them.
<br>
<br>Officer: Will do Captain.
<br>
<br>Mattias: Inform The Hamburg that we have arrived and the fuel station is under protection. Ask them for further orders and more recent intel.

<i>Raul felt the ship drop from hyperspace, the pilot just having finished the last of the briefing. He spoke to them, motioning them towards the flight deck...</i>
<br>
<br>"You heard Starwind...get into those ships, and get in that vaccuum. Keep your eyes sharp, and your senses clear. And remember the patrol pattern."
<br>
<br><i>Raul wasn't even waiting for the rest of them, moving towards his X-wing with all due haste. His R-unit was already being loaded into his ship, being locked into the slot for him. As Raul began to ascend the ladder, he spoke to his R-unit...</i>
<br>
<br>"If there are any slackers, I want to know immediately. Also, relay everything from our sensors to the Warspite's bridge...let them handle the rest of the comm traffic."
<br>
<br><i>Raul strapped himself in the cockpit, and slipped the flight helmet on, doing the pre-flight check...as the rest of his squad was doing the same. This was all routine to him now...just easy things, to make sure it was going to be a smooth entry. He hit the repulsorlifts, and began to drop from the Warspite's belly, followed by 11 other X-wings. Raul's voice crackled over the squad's headsets...</i>

<i>Captain Mattias sits with the mine operators in the main conference room.</i>
<br>
<br>Mattias: "I still think that we're most likely to be attacked from Sector 5. It's where there are only smaller, un-useable asteroids, this station is vital for fuel lines. If we are attacked, they'll be sure not to damage the station more than needed to conquer it."
<br>
<br>Station Commander: "But the easiest way goes here (points at sector 1).
<br>There's no entrance when coming from Sector 5."
<br>
<br>Mattias: "They'll probably launch a second squad once the area is secure. Look, right now, I'm the military Commanding Officer here, my greatest interest is to defend this station. When "The Angel" arrives, it will cover sector 5. "The Predator will protect Sector 1, since The Predator is faster and can hunt down smaller boarding craft. Payback will patrol the perimiter and provide back-up."
<br>
<br><i>Mattias' voice became more powerful, ordering and for for inexperienced miners, way more convincing. Mattias was absolutely sure, this was the best defence possible. The Angel of Death and MC-80 Payback where a couple of hours away.</i>
<br>
<br>Station Commander: "Well, I guess I'm not military tactician. If I have understood this right, you have to leave soon?"
<br>
<br>Mattias: "Oh, yes you're right, there's a big meeting on the main Orbital Station around Taragosh."
<br>
<br><i>Mattias, reached for his comlink and spoke:</i>
<br>
<br>"Predator, this is Captain Mattias, Prepare my shuttle for departure, I need to get to Taragosh Orbital Platform by tomorrow."
<br>
<br>"Predator here, understood Captain, I'll prepare the shuttle, escort and have them report to the station in 1 hour."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<br><i>The meeting was already over. Grand Admiral Simon, the High Admirals Horn and Angelus and a few other officers were still standing around a holographic map of the sector.
<br>A younger lieutenant ran into the conference room and saluted in front of Grand Admiral Simon; Michael Returned the salute.</i>
<br>
<br>"Admiral a shuttle with a fake ID code just escaped from the platform. We took a closer look onto the shuttle's ID, when it left hyperspace into the direction of the galactic border."
<br>
<br>"Well, ... maybe the Imperial spy. You found out the destination of the hyperjump."
<br>
<br>"Intel is currently calculating the the most realistic destinations in that area, but there is still the chance the shuttle made another hyperjump after arriaval to cover it's true destination."
<br>
<br>"When you made up a list with these destinations, you can send it to Admiral Horn, he can send some reconissaince Y-Wings to the systems."
<br>
<br>"Well, sir there is another problem."
<br>
<br>"Yes, Lieutenant?"
<br>
<br>"We have lost one of our convois that was evacuating A-731. Several of the freighters were transporting ores from A-731, so Admiral Andries thinks that pirates or hutts have captured the convoi. Somehow we had a hyperspace locator from one of the asteroid miners on one of the freighter, so we have it's current location. It's in the system A-708."
<br>
<br>"How much defense the convoi had?"
<br>
<br>"One Nebulon-B frigate and 3 corellian corvettes."
<br>
<br>"Well, ... thanks for your report, Lieutenant."
<br>
<br><i>Both were saluting and the lieutenant left the room, the Michael returned to the two High Admirals.</i>
<br>
<br>"Corran, Worf, I need need a carrier group from each of you. We lost a convoi in the system A-708. In case the offender attacked the convoi he had enough firepower to take out a frigate with escorts."
<br>
<br>"I guess Commander Starwind can do it with the Warspite."
<br>
<br>"Will send Captain Gustafsson with the Predator then."
<br>
<br>
<br><i>Lieutenant Forstholf was entering the A-708 System. His X-Wing had been modfied to identify ships and ID codes on a long range without been identified himself.
<br>He noticed a couple of older fighters like Headhunters and Y-Wings as well as a few T-Wings and other exotic crafts. A few Republican freighters and a lacer frigate with pirate ID code were drifting around a big asteroid at the border of an asteroid field.</i>
<br>
<br>"Ok R4, save all the data. We need to return to the fleet."

<br>
<br><i>His R-unit beeped back to him, not giving any sort of real response. As he flew his ship into the docking bay, and flicked on the repulsor lifts to land the starfighter, he was already beginning to unhook his flight harness.

<br>
<br>"Yeah, I have a bad feeling on this, spreading the fleet over so many systems while the Prometheus is going to be upgraded and the Immortal is damaged.

<i>It had taken Raul a little longer than he had expected to get the post-flight done, making sure everyone knew their time for patrol, and whatnot. But as he made his way to the bridge, he made it as quickly as humanly possible. En route to the bridge, Raul's comlink beeped, giving him a new set of orders. he grumbled, and turned around, acknowledging the words from the bridge, and did an about-face. As commander of the squad, he should be there, and he would grab his wing, and two others as escorts...leave the other 5 to rest. So, he spoke into the comlink, and the squad's private channel...</i>
<br>
<br>"I want Harls, Brandis, and Huckles to report to the docking bay again...we have escort duty for the incoming shuttle. The rest of you, keep to the schedule. Double time it folks."
<br>
<br><i>Raul was almost sprinting as he went back to the hangar bay, his R-unit beeping at his confusedly. Raul simply motioned to the flight deck officier, motioning he wanted the other ships prepaired, as well as his own. He climbed quickly up the ladder himself, and dropped into the cockpit. He didn;t need to do a pre-flight, considering he just finished the post-flight. But he was anxious...and, at the same time...angry, in a way. he didn't like having his chain jerked.</i>

<i>It was an odd feeling for Soniv, working on Imperial technology.  It wasn't new; indeed, far from it.  Soniv's initial training was at Sienar, studying the internal mechanics of a TIE; how it worked, what it cost to fuel, and all sorts of other nuances of the main Imperial fighters.
<br>
<br>No, the odd feeling was due to Soniv's undying hatred of the Empire and what it stood for.  They stole his childhood first; then they took his family from him.  Then, to strike back, he had to give up his career and his home.
<br>
<br>This left the embittered middle-aged tech, at that point just a late teen, with nothing to lose, no desire to gain, and a burning desire for revenge.  How ironic, he thought, that he would devote the other half of his life to destroying what he had learned to create in the first.  That grim satisfaction made him smile bleakly, as he finished the last coolant pump.  Then, his comlink was abuzz with chatter from the new arrivals.</i>  "So they're here early," <i>he thought,</i> "Good.  I was getting tired of banging these pipes anyway."
<br>
<br><i>Exiting the reactor chamber, Soniv felt the familiar feel of atmospheric pressure and gravity once more, as he stepped into a decontamination chamber, to cleanse his vacsuit.  He heard some more information about most of the command staff arriving to investigate the incident.  </i>"This is fortituous,"<i> he mused. </i>"I should be able to monitor their actions and ferret out any spies.  Something's not right, here.  The Immortal was attacked as soon as it came out of hyperspace.  I couldn't find any spies, but I'm not exactly a 23'er.  This couldn't have just been coincidence."
<br>
<br><i>Muttering about, he flipped his comlink into transmit mode, as he walked into the 'fighter bay. </i> "Lt. Commander Soniv Hope reporting, on board the Immortal.  We're fine; Command's just a bit shaken from all the events.  We were just conducting effective repairs before you arrived.  If I can be of any help, let me know.  Soniv out."
<br>
<br><i>With that, Soniv walked over to his own fighter, and began to tinker at it.  He always loved making sure that his fighter was in top condition; he would accept no less in the heat of battle.  Plus, as a Security agent, he had to make sure nobody sabotaged it...</i>

<br>
<br>"Ok, listen up. I want you three tight...the best you got, because if you aren't the High Command is gonna see it. That's right...we are escorting one of the top brass.

<br>
<br><i>The bridge of the Warspite had been, of course, expecting this, and as they approached, the comm crackled back, giving clearance, the the proper docking bay for the shuttle.

<i>Raul and the other three X-wing pilots landed in their docking bay with little else said, and Raul gave each of them a pat on the back. He was purposefully holding them up, giving the brass time to get out of sight. When that was done, Raul gave each of them their orders, and moved himself towards the exit of the bay. He told the flight officier to have his R-unit sent to his quarters when the post-flight check was done. he was going to have to erase the parts about the Grand Admiral off it...didn't want the news spread too fast. People might go and do stupid things to try and impress the brass...not something he wanted to have on his conscience. So as he got to his quarters, he keyed the door open, moving towards his bed, and sitting on it...thinking for a few.</i>

<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Soniv wiped his brow from under the TIE Advanced that was his personal starfighter. It was by no means modified cosmetically; it looked just like any regular TIE, save for the insignia on one of the wings, marking it as his own fighter. No, what made it special was the interior.
<br>
<br>One of the benefits of having nothing to live for and nothing to lose is that one does not need luxuries. Every single decicred of Soniv's pay that was spared from any living expenses was put into his fighter; optimized systems, installed with his extensive knowledge of Sienar tech, made his personal fighter state of the art.
<br>
<br>Optimized computer systems, increased fuel intakes, larger tanks, miniaturized systems...anything that could improve the fighter was installed. Soniv's particular TIE Advanced had systems not even the TIE Defender could match. It truly was the work of a gifted mind.
<br>
<br>With the maintenance work finished, Soniv rolled out from the 'fighter.</i> "Good, everything seems to work well," <i>he mused, to nobody in particular.</i> "Now, to take her for a test flight."
<br>
<br><i>Slipping into the vacuum suit, Soniv hopped into his TIE. Hooking up his helmet to the diagnostics systems, HUDs of every sort flashed before his eyes. Everything showed green; he was still in the hangar, after all. Turning on the comlink, he contacted docking control.</i>
<br>
<br>"Lt. Commander Hope to Docking Control, requesting clearance to launch."
<br>
<br><i>The controller responded quickly, as the bay was empty. All of the pilots were on leave, resting after the attack that crippled the Immortal.</i>
<br>
<br>"Docking Control to Lt. Commander Hope, you are cleared to launch." <i>The magnetic seal opened, allowing ships and other projectiles to leave the hangar.</i>
<br>
<br>"Lt. Commander Hope to Docking Control, I am launching now. Soniv out."
<br>
<br><i>Hitting the automatic launch procedure, the advanced fighter proceeded to come under the grasp of a docking automaton. The automaton proceeded to move the fighter away from the hangar, and into the launch bay. Activating the systems, Soniv launched out as soon as the device released his ship. He then sent a METOSP through the ship's comlink.</i> "Anyone who's out there, this is Lt. Commander Soniv Hope, launching from the Immortal. Nothing out of the ordinary, just taking my fighter for a test flight."
<br>
<br><i>With that, Soniv came out of the launch area, and began to circle the Immortal, almost as a vulture would circle its downed prey, waiting for some response before deviating from the Immortal's position.</i> "It's good to be in a fighter again," <i>Soniv thought out loud, albeit not to the comlink.</i> "It just...feels right."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Soniv Hope</p>
<p class="text">
"Well, I guess Admiral Horn already sent you the radar protocols of the X-Wing we sent into the system. If not he surely will do soon. Sure the number of fighters is ever difficult to calculate. There are Headhunters and Y-Wings in the area, but they maybe just use their older fighters for patrol to keep the better ones combat ready. So there maybe some better fighters covered in the hangars. The asteroid the radar scan is maybe the base of opperations, it's stupid to have our freighters around it, but who knows what's going on there. The lancer frigate, well you should be able to deal with that ship. The forces in the system weren't enough to take out our convoi, so it's possible the pirates have or had more forces. I guess it's nessesary to protect the capitol ships in this mission with some extra security."
<br>
<br>
<br><i>Soniv checked the radar and identified two TIE Fighter with Republican ID going in formation with him.</i>
<br>
<br>"Phi 2-1, here Gamma 3-1 could you change to the same code in red?"
<br>
<br><i>Soniv wasn't understanding first, ... code in red. Maybe the old Imperial variant of the 5th fleet communication code. Soniv switched the channel and enabled the old communication code.</i>
<br>
<br>"Gamma 3-1, you there?"
<br>
<br>"Affirmative sir, well, there is someone that likes to speak to you. In the starfield launge. He will like to play a card game with you."
<br>

"I guess we should be prepared for incoming reinforcements then, they probably have their main force stationed somewhere, deploying it to where it is needed.

<i>Tax stood up, looking at Gene's plan appearing on the hologram.</i>
<br>
<br>"I agree, though the problem with a Lancer Frigate is that it's designed to destroy fighters, maybe my A-wing squadron and one of your X-wing squadrons could clear up enemy fighters, then the Warspite or Predator makes a run at the Lancer, the lancer frigate isn't a capitol-to-capitol ship. But, if this succeeds, what's next? We don't know about the station's defenses, reinforcements or what kind of other fighters we're up against. You know a next move? Hold perimiter and play it as it comes?"
<br>

<br>
<br>When we exit hyperspace, majority of fighter craft will be launched, your goal is to attack any enemy fighters in the region, all Intel has been able to tell us are headhunters and y-wings patrolling, but, their must be better fighters in their hangar on the base cause that kind of weak firepower wouldn't of been able to capture our 6 freighters stationed around it.  There is a pirate Lancer frigate in this area, so, all fighters will be directed to STAY AWAY from it, keep enemy fighters off of us as the Warspite makes hit and runs on taking the frigate out.  Also, do not attack our friehgters, we want to try and recover these.

<br>2) Do not go for that Frigate
<br>3) Come back alive.
<br>
<br>I want 2 or 3 fighters to be ready to head back to the warspite if we get into trouble...and when we're certain enemy fighters have been neutralized, all B-Wings will be launched to proceed with their bombing of the base or if we can capture it to maybe gain more intel

Soniv out." <i>Deciding to go with the automatic procedure, rather than manually pilot his ship in, Soniv took the time to steel himself for the worst possible case; the situation where his cover was blown, and the person meeting with him was a plant for the Empire.</i>
<br>
<br><i>It was always a constant worry for the counter-spy. Even though he had no reason to live for himself, he knew full well that he did more good to the Republic, and consequently, more harm to the Empire he so hated, if he were alive rather than dead. While still preparing himself, Soniv rationalized that perhaps this really was a benign card game; after all, what else is there to do on a motionless artificial satellite? It was at this point that Soniv's TIE was firmly secured in the docking rack, and the HUD displayed,</i> "Docking Complete."
<br>
<br><i>Turning off the TIE's systems, and disconnecting his helmet from the diagnostics, Soniv stepped out of the fighter, changing back into his Sienar technician's uniform. Pressing a part of the chassis, a hidden compartment opened up from the TIE, revealing a BlasTech DL-44 Blaster Pistol. Taking it out, he strapped it to his hip, and promptly closed the compartment, making a mental note to replenish that stockpile after this card business was over with.
<br>
<br>Soniv began to walk across the decks of the Immortal now, occasionally getting a salute from the occasional deck officer or cadet. He didn't really care for formality; sure, he paid attention to those above him, but he pretty much treated anyone below his rank as an equal.
<br>
<br>Eventually, he reached the Starfield Lounge.</i> "Well, this is it. The moment of truth. Stay calm." Heeding his internal monologue, Soniv tempered his anxiety, looking calm as he opened the door.

<i>As Gene finished the briefing, Raul nodded, then rose, bowing his head to the man. He would then turn towards the pilots of White Squad, and he'd speak...</i>
<br>
<br>"Boys, we are the best this ship has...I want to make sure each and everyone of us comes back from this alive. A headhunter isn;t much worse than we are...just a few years older, so keep sharp. Remember...these guys don't know how good we are...and the same is true. Keep your eyes peeled, and those scanners on full range. Sing your targets, and happy hunting."
<br>
<br><i>Raul moved towards his personal X-wing, the former smuggler thinking that perhaps he'd lose half his squad in this fight...maybe more. The life expectenacy of a fighter pilot in a major skirmish wasn't very high. However...he would do everything in his power to make sure as many of his pilots could return to their families, and their lives after this. As he began up the ladder to his cockpit, he noticed his R-unit being loaded into the slip for it. He spoke in a soft voice...</i>
<br>
<br>"Remember that pattern...if we get in trouble, I am going to let you run it...my reflexes aren;t good enough in this type of ship. In a freighter...sure. But in an X-wing...totally different. Got it?"
<br>
<br><i>The R-unit beeped an affirmative, and he pulled the hatch down, locking him in the cockpit. The flight helmet slipped over his head, the eye shielding coming down, and the comm unit placed near his mouth. he began silently doing the pre-flight checks...</i>

<br><i>The MC90 Mon Calamari Cruiser Warspite and the Venator-Class Star Destroyer Predator entered hyperspace, both ships on high alert and all fighters with eager pilots sitting in the seats.
<br>
<br>Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind was sitting in the bridge. Thinking things over, reaching out with the Force in an attempt to foresee what was going to happen, sadly, it was all a blur, nothing to focus on, not even a remote thought by a lonely Headhunter pilot doing his regular patrol, without being aware of the two Republican Ships coming for them.
<br>
<br>Captain Mattias Gustafsson wandered around the bridge, checking with his personnel that everything was alright, he looked calm, gave an expression that he had everything under control, infact the situation was the opposite, he had a great responsibility for his pilots and the ship's crew. He didn't like the idea of going in without full intel of what they're up against. What kind of reinforcements the enemy has. Everything indicates that they are pirates, but wouldn't pirates withdraw from a zone where both Imperial and Republican Forces were fighting? Are the Imperials and Pirates in league? Would we find a full Imperial Fleet backed up with Pirates? It all became more like a trap for every thought that crossed Mattias' head. Can't turn back now, all we could do was to spring the trap.</i>
<br>
<br><i>And hope for the best....</i>
<br>
<br><i>Captain Gustafsson was still standing on the bridge, standing in the front looking out into hyperspace. An officer approached and said:</i>
<br>
<br>"Captain, we are leaving hyperspace in 5 minutes"
<br>
<br>"Very well, alert all stations, prepare the fighters."
<br>
<br><i>Mattias sighed and then straightened up, walking to the command chair, sitting down.</i>
<br>
<br>"Report"
<br>
<br>"Leaving hyperspace in 2 minutes, shields are at maximum, engines too. All batteries reporting ready to go. Crimson, ready, Cobalt, ready, Auric, ready and Beryl is loading up."
<br>
<br>"Alright, Cobalt are our main force, Auric is back-up. Crimson are to defend the Capitol ships and Beryl will stay in the hangar until needed."
<br>
<br>"Captain, we're leaving hyperspace"
<br>
<br>"Stay Sharp People, everyone on their toes. Mistakes means casualties. Play it by the book"
<br>
<br><i>The Predator dropped out of hyperspace, rather far away from the asteroids to avoid collision.</i>
<br>
<br>"We have been noticed, multiple targets on inbound, preliminary scans indicates Z-95 Headhunters and Y-Wings"

<br>Tax: "Station Commander, this is Captain Mattias Gustafsson from the New Republican 5th Fleet. I order you to stand down and return republican freighters and resources. I hope for your sake that none of the freighter's crew are hurt."
<br>
<br>"Ahh.. Captain Mattias Gustafsson, I assume Admiral Karper didn't come for this trip? As for the freighters, they're yours if you can survive long enough."

Not more than a hand full of original humans were visiting the lounge, but that was the usual quote in the 1st battlegroup. Soniv directly noticed three officers sitting apart from the other visitors of the lounge. A Rear Admiral, grey hair, from the 1st clone series together with two lieutenants, one of them a human. Commander Hope had notice the three cause the human lieutenant was looking on him.

<br><i>That said, Raul and his wing broke the formation, followed in suit by the rest of his squad, engaging various Headhunters and Y-wings as they could. His pilots were good, better than most of their fighters, but there was the occasional mistake from his pilots, and after several minutes of intense dogfighting, 10 of his fighters remained, and most of the squad of Y-wings were decimated, as well as some of the Headhunters.

<br>
<br>"When the Y-Wings are within range tell Cobalt to withdraw and form-up and then fire all concussion missiles at the Y-Wings, then direct our shields full front and let all laser batteries open full fire. I don't want anything to hit us. Then Cobalt will attack again and whipe them out."

<br>
<br>"Looks like after the Y-Wing squadrons, there's not pretty much just cleaning left."
<br>
<br>"Comm Officer, hail the Station. Offer them a surrender, I think we've shown our strength."
<br>
<br><i>The hail was sent, but no answer was hailed back</i>
<i>Many of the pirate fighters and bombers were shot down, others had escaped. A few were still seeking the combat with the Rpublican squadrons while most were withdrawn to the asteroid station that was still fireing with all laser batteries they had. A few Headhunters tried to escort some starting transports from the station into the asteroid belt.
<br>
<br>Suddenly a few Pirate IDs appeared on the scanners. An Inderdictor, two Carrack Cruisers and one Corellian Corvette had left the hyperspace directly behind the Republican attack fleet. The Interdictor was starting a squadron of TIE Avengers equipped with conclussion missles while the Carrack Cruisers were starting Starchasers equipped with torpedos.
<br>
<br>Michael was checking the the model numbers of the Avengers with the remnants of the Imperial database in the ship computers of the Warspite, but he didn't found it there. Maybe the parts containing the fighter had been like most of the database, when the ship chnaged to the Republican opperation system, or the Avengers were just newer models.
<br>
<br>The Starchasers had splitten up into two groups, one for each carrier, and it just took seconds till the groups reached the missle range of the capitol ships and launched their first load of torpedos. Meanwhile the Avengers started hunting for the Republican starfighters.</i>

He flipped his laser cannons to quad-fire mode as he finally got a few clean shots, and pummeled the Avenger in front of him. No time for celebration as he flew through the bright flash of starfighter debris and exploding fuel, already moving to save one of the remaining X-wings.

The coordinates were between the battling corvette, and the Warspite...where the turbolaser fire was heaviest. As the four ships streaked through, Raul got a tingle in the back of his mind...something told him about just when to do this. As he felt it, his voice broke through the comm system...</i>

<br><i>White 5 did as ordered, his s-foils closing as he went to full burn, just avoiding a turbolaser blast. The Avenger behind him, however, wasn't so lucky, being vaped by an overwhelming laser force. Raul's X-wing twisted, avoiding a second volley of laser fire...using his basic attunement to the Force to his advantage, then, his R-unit whistled...worried to death as he could almost feel the heat from the turbolasers. One mistake, and he was space dust. However...luck, and the Force, were on his side, as the Avenger behind him got clipped by a turbolaser blast, then spun out of control into the Corvette, slamming into the hull of the small capital ship.

<br>
<br>"Not that we know about, we could send out a message."
<br>
<br>"Do it, and how is our shields holding?"
<br>
<br>"Warspite has taken most if the hits, we're at 80% forward shields and dropping. The Corvette has been destroyed but the Carracks are moving into attack position. We can't go head-on with two Carracks, Captain."

<br>"Comm, new orders. The Interdictor is our primary target, and tell Gene to order the same thing to his bombers. As for us, pump up our shields and tell our lasers that I don't want anything to get to the Warspite. What about our fighters?"

<i>A Republican freighter just had docked at the orbital platform in the Taragosh system.

The orbital platform had absolutly no chance and parts of the station had wiped out the smaller ships transports around the plaform before anyone was able to react. The shields of the ISD Immortal and the ISD Hamburg XII were absorbing most of the explosions, but a few parts of the orbital platform managed to break through the shield and did some hull damages.

<br>
<br>"Looks like the other 6 missing transports, or at least some of them were used to infiltrate the orbital platform in Taragosh and two supply deports in nearby planetary systems with a explosive load. Somehow they got special Republican military IDs, and the inspecting patrols didn't care for the explosive load, since they were officially carriing ammunition. Admiral Horn is summoning the remnant of the fleet in the Taragosh system. He will surely contact you cause of that, when you have cleared the system from the pirate remnants. The Republican navy high command is pretty upset, cause we weren't able to protect the station, and I have been ordered back to Coruscant to explain the situation."

<br>
<br><i>2 transports whizzed by the assault shuttles, attempting to make a run for it as the assault shuttles began to dock into the hangar, alrerady a hail of blasts were being shot at the shuttles</i>
<br>
<br>Alright, shoot smoke bombs out and come out in critcal fire style, secure the hangar and progress on.
<br>
<br><i>the shuttle making a loud *htud noise as smoke bombs were shot, creating a smokey hell of blasts as the shuttle door lowered, his assault team pouring out, blasts being returned as the shuttle's turrets whailed shots at the mobile defense units, Gene's light saber flciking on as he rushed out as well, sending blasts back towards some of the pirates</i>

<i>Tax flew past the Predator, it didn't look that bad. Mostly damage in electronics systems but everything was under control. Tax heard the battleshatter over the comm. Tax turned the A-Wing around again, full throttle towards the asteroid base. He felt that he was needed more on the asteroid.</i>

<p class="text">
<i>soon, the hangar was cleared, 10 pirates laid stunned and 5 dead, Gene losing 2 of his soldiers as he looked about </i>
<br>
<br>Send word to Tax and see if he wants the prisoners or place them on Warspite, Bravo group, move on in and progress slowly, Delta group, secure the hangar and see if we can get any of our droids into the mainframe to get a map and have access to controls.  Charlie, follow in with bravo and watch their backs.
<br>
<br>Something...doesn't feel right in the force....
<br>
<br><i>Gene would head a different way from where he was sending his troops, something did not feel exactly right...</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax came closer and closer to the asteroid, his comm flashed.</i>
<br>
<br>"Hangar secured, Captain. Commander Starwind wonders what he should do with the prisoners?"
<br>
<br>"Tell him to take them to the Warspite or Predator as quickly as he can. Also tell him, that I'll join in. There's not a damn reason for me to stay up here."
<br>
<br><i>Tax aimed the A-Wing's nose towards the Hangar, an assault shuttle just disembarked new troops and prisoners were being loaded aboard.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>It would indeed look like a large mass invasion, assault shuttles were moving prisoners and wounded troops back ansd forth, a Liutenant with a heavy reapter stood by as he heard Tax's transmission, sending back 'Sir, Liutenant Commander Starwind isn't here, he went on out for some odd reason, we've got groups bravo and charlie engaged with prisoners on floor 2, enar the main controls, and charlie are reporting droids are as we speak attempting to hack into the mainframe to get us an exact count of enemies and maps' one could see men laying on stretchers either dead or wounded critically, new troops being moved in every now and then</i>
<br>
<br><i>Gene would be tking a different way around the battle at hand, something drew him...to the meat storage area...visions of the force flashing as he felt the coldness, evilly, and darkness produced by some vile user of the dark side, pictures of his men being killed, slaughtered, and tortured overcame Gene as he broke out in a cold sweat, continueing on his path towards where the feeling originates...</i>

<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax entered the hangar. Found a small place to land his A-Wing. He exited the craft.</i>
<br>
<br>"Who's in command here?"
<br>
<br>"Me sir, Gene is out fighting somewhere, we don't really know where he is."
<br>
<br>"Very well, round up the Predator boys. We'll progress onwards and capture some positions. You stay here and keep things running. Put up defensive positions in the corridors so we have something here incase we are pushed back."
<br>
<br>"Understood, Captain."
<br>
<br>"And if Gene shows up, notify me and keep him here. I need to talk to him."
<br>
<br><i>Tax recieved a blaster, more heavier kind than his sidearm. He turned around, facing his soldiers.</i>
<br>
<br>"Team 1 and 2, you're with me. Team 3 help the Warspite boys, they're locked up on Floor 2. Team 4, stay here if anyone wants you to go somewhere, I want to be notified. Team 3 why are you still here? Go go go! Now, Teams 1 and 2. Give me one of them armours and get moving!"

<br>

<br>
<br>Soldier:"Captain, Floor 1 is secured. We're progressing on Floor 2 however slowly."
<br>
<br>"Let's speed up the process."
<br>
<br><i>Tax and his team dashed to floor 2, they heard the fighting. Tax could see computers, desks and stuff on the ground working as cover. It was a medium large room. The Republican Forces outnumbered the pirates greatly, however the pirates was dug in pretty deep and heavily armed. There were some small arms fire, nothing serious. When Tax got there with his men it was a typical stalemate. Tax approached the plutoon commander.</i>
<br>
<br>"Report"
<br>
<br>"The enemy is dug in on the other end, pinning us down. They're heavily armed so we can't attack directly we'd be gunned down. We can't use grenades because the preasure from the detonation could breach the hull and we'd be sucked out."
<br>
<br>"This is why we need Commander Starwind here. Dammit! Alright, we still need this station captured. Tried talking to them?"
<br>
<br>"I've tried, I had to dodge pretty fast."
<br>
<br>"So much for a peaceful solution. We'll how about sneaking against the wall while the rest of us unloads on them? I mean, we're like 20 men here and they're, what?, 6?
<br>
<br>"If you say so, Captain. I guess it could work."
<br>
<br>"I'll take one of my groups, when I give you the signal, you fire like crazy at their position. When we get there we'll charge em', while they're busy with my group, you take your men and charge from your position. Now spread the troopers out so you cover as many positions as possible."
<br>
<br><i>Tax pointed at Team 1, then patted his back to signal that they were to follow him. Meanwhile the Plutoon Commander spread his troops out as much as possible. Tax moved, closely followed by Team 1. Tax caught the Plutoon Commander's attention. Tax nodded, the Commander yelled and stood up, fireing at the enemy position. Tax dashed, closely to the wall, it worked, they moved without being noticed. When they reached the position the Republicans stopped shooting. One of the Pirates looked up from their cover. Tax smashed the pirate's jaw with his blaster and then jumped over, closely followed by his soldiers. A few shots was heard, screams and afew crunching noises, three seconds of silence then another scream. Tax looked up, blood was smudged to his face. He gave a thumbs up to the Commander.</i>

<br>"No sir...Lt. Cmdr. Starwind went off by himself on the base, and they are having a hell of a time finding him. Captian Tax is not happy about it."

<br><i>Raul quickly got back into his flight suit, his R-unit already making it's way to the docking bay. As he checked his blaster, thumbing the safety off, and his breathing aparatus, he closed his eyes again...feeling out into the open space...and he felt it again...the dark grip...then, it faded, like...extinguished suddenly. He didn't like the feel of that, so he made his way quickly to the bay, and climbed the ladder to his X-wing. Once inside, he did a quick pre-flight, and was in the vacuum in a matter of seconds.

<br>
<br>
<br>"Stormtroopers? DEFENSIVE POSITIONS!!!"
<br>
<br><i>Tax pointed at two places in the room and the soldiers started packing up the repeating blasters, the room was in full commotion. Everyone was grabbing what cover they could find and aimed towards the automated doors.</i>

<br>"Captain! I've found the blast protection console! If we can activate it then we'll be able to use grenades without being sucked out into the vaccum."
<br>

<i>Tax waited, his heartbeats clearly reminding him that he was alive. Tax could see the doors opening, the stormtroopers rushed in, fireing, then came the Republican answer, 20 men fired at the door, the two repeating blasters lay a barrage of fire preventing the stortroopers from moving. Tax aimed, and fired. The rocket launched, being a small missile made for indoor combat it went straight forward and hit the automated door with a loud bang. Smoke and small debris flew across the room. The blaster fire had stopped and when the smoke made things visible again all stormtroopers was dead and the door was a big hole.</i>

However, hiding like he did, in a doorway, he was mostly conceiled. The Blastech DL-44 pistol in his hand was flipped to the 'stun' setting, and that would help conserve ammo.

<br><i>Raul was slowly closing his eyes, trying to use the fledgling Force abilities he had to sense how many he might be facing...and how ready for them they were. Not much got to him...he was still feeling the emotional backlash from Gene's fight with the Sith. So he focused instead on his own battle readiness...let the scanners and whatnot do that part of the job. He got a quick update on the potential targets and thought for a moment...on how to keep the fighters trapped inside. he thought the first rocket volley aimed at the hangar doors would keep the fighters and other craft from making a quick exit into space...which would accomplish one part of his mission.</i>

<i>Tax remained behind Gene and his team, Gene shouting "3" as they burst into the hangar. Tax shouting "NOW!" as he stood up and ran towards the entrance seeing Gene's lightsaber deflecting loads of blastershots while his troops ran to find cover here and there.</i>
<br>
<br>"Move! Get to securing those shuttles!"
<br>
<br><i>Tax paced through the hagar, avoiding battle as much as he could although he could see that Gene and Raul had their hands full</i>

<i>Raul heard the go signal, and as soon as he did, his squad began laying down covering fire for him, as he brought the missle launcher up from behind the plasteel barrier he was waiting behind. He looked through the viewfinder, finding the range and the proper shot vector, then he pushed the button, releasing the rocket in a beeline for the hangar bay doors. A few seconds later, an explosion rocked the bay, as the top of the hangar near the doors fell down, effectively blocking it for the larger shuttles, but not for the fighters. He grunted, shaking his head a little...not quite what he had expected. A buzz near the back of his mind was all the warning he got, as he ducked down, a laser blast scorching the weall behind him, directly where his head had been. "Sithspawn!", he muttered to himself, placing the rocket launcher down, and he motioned to one of the troopers...</i>
<br>
<br>"Target the most nimble of the fighters first...I'll help lay covering fire."
<br>
<br><i>The trooper nodded, picking up the launcher, loading it quickly, and targeting an Interceptor still docked, but prepairing to launch. The 'whoosh' from the rocket was heard, and the TIE exploded in amulti-colored flash of light and sound. Meanwhile, Raul was using the DL-44 to lay a few well-placed shots on some of the stormies still in place...</i>

<p class="text">
<i>Tax watched the rocket fly across the hangar, successfully crippeling the hangardoors. Making the shuttles unable to leave the hangar thus making Tax's job alot easier.
<br>Tax and his team had taken the first shuttle without much trouble and was preparing to move on the the second and last shuttle. Another explosion was heard and Tax could hear metal against the metal floor. He looked out and saw parts of a TIE Interdictor scattered all over the hangar. Gene was still swirling his saber around deflecting as much as he could, his team had taken a few losses but most of the troopers had found cover and was fighting the last Imperial positions with help from Raul and his team. It was a winning battle, two TIE Interceptors left the hangar in a hurry, one of them was close to lose control of the fighter since he scratched one of his wings against the hangar dorrs debris. They left the hangar, made it out a few feet before a large concentration of laser blasts destroyed them, Tax could see three A-wings fly by.</i>
<br>
<br>"Alright team, get ready to assault that last shuttle, no mistakes."
<br><i>The team consisting of 4 soldiers nodded and checked their gear. Tax told two of them to go first followed by Tax and the two others.
<br>
<br>They started running, when they past the shuttle one of the two infront got shot straight in the chest and fell backwards with a scream. The other one reached the shuttle, fired at a stormtrooper standing on the ramp before he got inside. Tax and the two other soldiers was close beind and entered, Tax saw the first soldier in a close-quarters battle with the shuttle's pilot, there were no other signs of life. Tax approached the two combatants, he grabbed the pilot by the neck and tossed him backwards, it was a tiny little pilot.</i>
<br>
<br>"Stop trying you Imperial shithead. Secure the shuttle, move! You, my Imperial sithspit, you're gonna be my personal informant when we've secured the hangar."
<br>
<br><i>Tax heard a couple of light explosions from the hangar, the laser fire stopped, he grabbed the pilot in an necklock and stepped outside. The hangar was taken. He saw troopers securing the Imperial position, or what was left of them after the grenade attack.</i>
<br>
<br>"Gene! Get over here, we need to discuss things!"
<br><i>Tax also waved at Raul to get there.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Raul patted each of the men under his short-term command, smiling and giving them a word or two of encouragement, and congradulations. He then slipped the blaster into his holdster, and began to make his way towards the 'command' post. His steps were quick, but his eyes remained on Gene the whole time. He, perhaps better than any of the others, knew what Gene had gone through, and he was a little worried about him. He came up to Tax and Gene, and spoke softly...</i>
<br>
<br>"Hey boss, you feeling alright? The emotional baggage from your fight with the Sith woke me up...should have felt it coming a parsec away...but, eh...I never was very good at it."
<br>
<br><i>He chuckles a little as he watches the two other officiers, and takes ina few deep breaths. It was good to have this part over...but now the paperwork would begin. An inward groan escaped his lips...he hated burecratic nonsense.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
"Right guys, extremely well done with everything. Gene, I want a report on this whole sith buisness, I want to know what I might encounter. Anyway, I think we should head back to our ships and send a report to HQ and see what we should do next."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
After I talk to the council about these matters, Tax.  I am still unsure of what is going on here myself.  Eh, Raul...let's just say it was an experience I never want to go back through again...like a teaser or something to the Trials one must go through...Anyways, aye.
<br>
<br><i>looking around to his men as he nodded </i>
<br>
<br>Get some rest, take turns patrolling till more reinforcements arrive, Raul, Your over my group here till we receive more info from HQ.  Also...makes sure every soldier gets some sleep, I want everyone to be ready for later.
<br>
<br><i>saluting to them both as he began to slowly walk back towards the main shuttle bay, the jedi didn't understand what was going on, especially with that sith, eyes looking down every now and then at that lightsaber the sith left behind...still...something was not right in the force</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Raul nodded to Gene, letting the CO go off, and get some rest...he needed some. Raul would then nod to Tax, and turn, making his way towards the men. he began issuing orders for the remaining defense of the hangar bay, and the station, thinking to barrack of the men here...less travel time, for now. He began to make the arriangements, being somewhat fresh...most had been in straight combat, where he had gotten a little sleep. So, he was a little less worse off than the rest.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax returned Gene's salute and nodded back at Raul as he also left. He then turned to his men.</i>
<br>
<br>"I have to get back to the Predator, remain here and help the Warspite boys as much as you can. I'll call for you when I know more."
<br>
<br><i>The soldiers saluted, Tax returned the salute and turned around heading for the main hangar, with the little shuttle pilot still stuck in an necklock.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>would return to his shuttle, nodding to his pilot</i>
<br>
<br>Back to the Warspite, and take your time pilot.
<br>
<br>Right Sir
<br>
<br><i>Gene would walk to the back, sitting down at a small desk with a holo link near, turning, he would send a message to the council</i> "Masters, The force in which I'm feeling is very different...much different than anything I have ever felt before...I also have encountered something odd....a Sith...I thought they have been extincted or in hiding?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax reached the hangar. He saw Gene's shuttle leave, Tax entered his own shuttle and sat down at his usual spot.</i>
<br>
<br>"To the Predator, make it quick. There's no time to waste, I must inform Grand Admiral Simon about the situation."
<br>
<br><i>The shuttle made haste, it left the hangar and put all energy to engines and began it's journey back to the Predator, it didn't take long before they reached the Predator's hangar. The shuttle landed and Tax moved quickly towards the bridge.
<br>
<br>He entered the bridge "Captain on the bridge" followed by salutes greeted him.</i>
<br>
<br>"Greetings, I have no time to waste, comm scrambled transmission to Grand Admiral Simon. [Admiral, Captain Gustafsson reporting. Commander Starwind and I has successfully secured the asteroid station. Encountered Imperial Stormtroopers, the pirates are in league with the Imperials. Commander Starwind has encountered what he has identified as a Sith, he is currently informing Master Corran and I think he will be able to tell you more. However, I request permission to head out and track down the Imperial and Pirate fleet. Are there any local authorities or Republican forces nearby that can defend the asteriod station? What are your orders? Captain Gustafsson, out.]"

<i>Raul worked keeping things in order as he began to crew rotations, to keep the on duty people fresh...it was pretty routiene, this part of the job. He hated this...boring. But, it was part of the duty. He did the best he could, trying to let the two senior officiers get some rest. He could rest later.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
<i>would send the message on to Yavin IV, the shuttle landing in the Warspite hangar as he nodded to the pilot and walked on out,  scrawny Liuetenant ran up to Gene</i>
<br>
<br>Sir, Welcome back aboard, Our brig is almost to near maxed capacity from all the prisoners we took in, we're starting the interrogation process now, anything you want us to try and go for?
<br>
<br><i>Gene would look at the man for a moment</i>
<br>
<br>The whereabouts of any and all imperial ships or a homebase or fleets around, the pirate stuff is something secondary right now with the imperial problem bigger....Nip it at the bud, not the leaf.
<br>
<br>Send word as well to Tax on what shall we do next....
<br>
<br><i>heading on up to the bridge as he nodded and took his seat, revolving around alittle bit</i>
<br>
<br>Give me full damage report of the lasat battle, assessments, and repairs made, and what is still broke.

<i>On the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar.
<br>
<br>The Admirals Corran Horn and Psylor Lock were standing on the bridge overseeing the current situation on Taragosh. A Commander of the Republican Intelligence entered the room. He saluted quickly and turned to Corran.</i>
<br>
<br>"Admiral we have decrypted the information brought to us by Commander Hope. Looks like the Remnant Imperial Intelligence used a Communications Center at Aurora to coordinate their actions. It seems to be the only location mentioned on on the datacrystal."
<br>
<br>"Thanks Commander."
<br>
<br><i>The Admiral saluted and turned to Admiral Lock.</i>
<br>
<br>"A trap Corran?" Psylor mentioned.
<br>
<br>"Possible, but I don't think so. In case the Remnants wanted a confrontation with our fleet they could have attacked us much earlier when we were divided and more vulnerable. In an assault against Aurora we dicide time and strength of our appearance, makes organizing a trap pretty complicated and risky."
<br>
<br><i>Corran went down the walkway to a communication console with a comm officer.</i>
<br>
<br>"Lieutenant, I want a directive sent to the entire fleet. We summon our forces at Reserve Point three, repeating, Reserve Point three. And tell them that I have got a list of supposed promotions from Admiral Ackbar and I would like to give them out there."
<br>
<br><i>Reserve Point three was the code name for the A-749 system. An dual star system without any planets. Exept of the stars the planetary system just consisted of lots of nothing. Really the last point someone would search for something.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax had sent his message when Gene contacted him</i>
<br>
<br>"Message Gene back, we are ordered to Reserve Point Three, this station is now out of our hands. I guess HQ will make sure it's defended, I'll make sure our escort ship gets here, to keep something here. Maybe you should make sure the personnel on the station has everything they need? I will get my people back onboard and then go to Reserve Point Three."
<br>
<br><i>Tax was tired, running low on energy, he however remained awake. As soon as the ship entered hyperspace he would get some sleep. Tax had heard news from Corran, he guessed the Grand Admiral was busy.</i>
<br>
<br>"Send shuttles to the station make sure all our personnel gets back here, order our fighters report back to the hangar and prepare us for hyperspace."
<br>
<br><i>Tax leaned back, resting alittle as he awaited replies from either Gene or Simon.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>would nod as he received the message, looking over to his helmsman</i>
<br>
<br>Plot course for Reserve point three, send message to the asteroid ops and ask them if they be needing anything else, if not, send shuttles to pick up our crews, Have all fighters return back to the ship and to get some sleep
<br>
<br><i>Gene was tired as hell, but, he didn't show it, watching as the shuttles were dispatched towards the Asteroid</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>A Nebulon-B frigate arrived first in the A-749 system. A squadron of X-Wings left its hangars and spread over the system. Half an hour later a convoi of Republican freighters arrived in the system. 3 of the freighters started to connect with each other building a temporary ship dock. It took two hours till the Zentar arrived there, followed by the ISD Hamburg XII. Freighters and tankers directly started to dock with the incomming ships to refill them with all kinds of supplies.</i>
<br>
<br><i>High Admiral Horn was turning to one of the Communications officers.</i>
<br>
<br>"Send a request to Captain Gustafsson and Commander Starwind. They should send me lists with their casaulties. Need them to request replacements from the Republican High Command."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax halfslept on the bridge, thinking things over now when he had more time. He must of fallen asleep because when he became aware of the world around him it was right before one of the lieutenants approached him to say that all squadrons had reported in and that the shuttles recently docked with the Predator. We were ready to leave.
<br>
<br>Right before Tax gave the order to enter hyperspace the comm flashed.</i>
<br>
<br>"It's from High Admiral Horn, requesting list of casualties and what materials we need."
<br>
<br>"We need repairs on our proton torpedo's electronics systems and we need 8 new X-Wings, 6 new Y-Wings and 4 new A-Wings. 7 new X-Wing pilots, 5 new Y-Wing pilots and 2 new A-Wing pilots. We've lost 8 ground soldiers and we need two new workers in the proton torpedoes bay."
<br>
<br><i>Tax shook his head, this was the bad part of his commanding role.</i>
<br>
<br>"Alright, take us into hyperspace. And make sure Commander Starwind has everything under control before we leave."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>would of received the message as well, looking down to his datapad, he would quickly calculate up some stuff</i>
<br>
<br>I need repairs to my deflector shield, laser turret C-D, and photon tubes 1 and 2.  Need atleast 7 new X-Wings and pilots, 4 new B-wings and pilots.  Lost about 5 ground soldiers and a shuttle pilot, need some new R droids because the current ones we have are...alil too old....
<br>
<br><i>would send the message as the shuttles returned aboard, nodding to his helmsman</i>
<br>
<br>Take us on into hyperspace, Mr. Sulu.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax recieved word that Commander Starwind sent his message and was prepared, the Warspite was getting into position to jump to hyperspace.</i>
<br>
<br>"We're ready, sir"
<br>
<br>"Take us into hyperspace, I will retire, wake me up when we're approaching Reserve Point Three."
<br>
<br>"Will do sir, get some rest, we'll handle things."
<br>
<br><i>Tax stood up from his chair, waited for the asteroids to disappear behind him before leaving the bridge. He headed straight for his quarters, he undressed from his armour and fell asleep quickly on his bed. He had a weird dream, dark clouds was surrounding him, he felt that he was alittle cold, someone was watching him. The dream stopped, Tax fell more deeply asleep, without dreams. He suddenly heard a loud ding. He woke up.</i>
<br>
<br>"What is it?"
<br>
<br>"We're 15 minutes away from Reserve Point Three Captain."
<br>
<br>"Alright, thank you ensign."
<br>
<br><i>Tax stood up and got dressed again, standard uniform, and left his quarters, heading for the bridge.</i>
