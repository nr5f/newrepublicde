<p class="textwhite">
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey Rad, we got a problem with the hyperdrive," Deejay called from the cockpit. Even though the droid was capable of flying and managing the ship, he wasn't entirly equipped to maintain it. I thought the droid was very helpful and at sometimes, funny.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just Bruce, my seventeen-year-old brother, Deejay, a modified Kalibac Industries DJ-09 maintenance droid, and me aboard the modified YT-1300 Freighter, the Gargoyle. The ship had become quite popular ever since Han Solo and Chewbacca had joined the Rebellion with the Millenium Falcon. We were lucky to have bought the four we have for our shipping company before the prices skyrocketed. Our father, Gerard Greystone ran a privately owned shipping company. This was Bruce's third delivery with me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, Bruce. We still got a job to do." Bruce nodded and stood up after a two-hour game of sabbac. I hurried after him. I was surprised to find that the hyperdrive had malfunctioned and brought us out of hyperspace right in front of a Victory-Class II Star Destroyer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't touch anything. The control board just started flashing a warning and brought us out of hyperspace."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat down in the captain's seat and said, "Okay, Deejay, I'll take it from here." Bruce sat down next to me. "Three years after the Battle at Endor and they still patrol these parts," I commented to myself. Obviously, Bruce heard me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yep, but they're still too much for us to handle. What'll we do if they decide to board us and check out cargo," Bruce asked with a very anxious look on his face. He was also itching in his seat. I tried to remain calm."We'll try to get everything related to the Rebellion hidden away. It might just be easier to contact them. Unidentified Victory-Class Star Destroyer, this is the YT-1300 Freighter Gargoyle. Do you copy?" There was no response. I tried again. There was still no response. "Bruce, try to get a reading on their current activities."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"There isn't anything going on. There aren't any life signs either." He looked at me. "What happened?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but I say we go in for a closer look." I sat and thought about that for a moment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not such a bad idea, Deejay! If there isn't anyone aboard."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We could take it home! That would be great! My third delivery run and we find a Star Destroyer."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't get too excited. Even though it looks in good condition, we may not be able to get it home. Let's take a look anyway, shall we?"
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aboard the dark and fairly new ship was not all that pleasant. The air was old and stale. All of the offices or rooms were empty. The hanger bay was also bare. It appeared all of the escape pods were jettisoned, too. The ship turned out to be a complete ghost ship. The most surprising thing was that the master computer had been completely erased of all records and information. I pulled my comlink off of my belt and turned it on. "Bruce you read?" I brushed some cobwebs out of my face with my blaster as I walked back to the Gargoyle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, I'm here. What's the news?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This place is as dead as a Tatooine desert. It looks like they were expecting company that didn't come. They erased the master computer and took everything that could be important. How's the outside look?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing too bad. There are only a few spots near the center that have been blown open. That's all. You should-" He was suddenly cut off by a blast from outside. "We got trouble. Get back to the docking bay. I'll take the ship there."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deejay, you're flying. Bruce, get to the guns. I'm on my way!" I stuffed the comlink back onto my belt and ran to the hanger bays. I was barely up the entrance ramp when we were heading into battle. What I saw was slightly nerve-racking. Half of a squadron of Toscan Fighters was swarming about us. Bruce was already manning the lower guns, so I ran to the other set. Bruce had already taken out two fighters by the time my targeting computer was up and running, but they were still coming hard. I swiveled right and left, up and down, trying to destroy the raiders. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw two making a pass at me. I jerked up and right. Red cannon fire blew from my turrets, but I missed them. I stopped firing for a couple seconds. I don't know why, but when I fired again I took out both the fighters in one shot. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were only two fighters left now. "Hey Rad! I scanned one of the fighters. It is owned by a group of space pirates."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks Deejay, but keep flying. Were taking quite a bit of damage." He tells me things at the worst times. I looked back at my scanner, but it was clear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awesome! We really showed them." Bruce looked up to me as he climbed back up to the cockpit. I started back down, too.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"See, those simulators really paid off," I exclaimed to Bruce as I slapped him on the back. "I'm glad you're finally able to come with us on these little delivery runs. Now, let's go fix the hyperdrive."
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to get to Mynok Station only half a standard hour behind schedule. Everything else went well. I even treated Bruce to a glass of a special drink at the Station's cantina. I told Father about what happened out by the Star Destroyer when we got home. I also gave him the coordinates. Our dad, Bruce, and I went out to get the ship the next day, brought it home, and named it the Lost Soul.
