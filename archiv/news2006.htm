<p class="textwhite"><b>18th November 2006: 1st Addition to the Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well, here is the 1st Addition to the Fleet Command Report. A couple of promotions that went through the Fleet Command Council.
<br>The status of the second Fleet Mission Run On hasn't been cleared for now, but I'm happy to see that the popularity of Behind the Shades is increasing.
<br>The NAC question is also still open now and the Rebel Squadrons are currently working on the ORW 3 bot.
<br>Hopefully more news on these topics in the next addition.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Commodore Syndic</font> is hereby promoted to Rear Admiral.
<br>Well, this is again one of these funny promotions, where the promoted officer maybe don't even have an idea that the High Command has the decision about his promotion on the task list. I don't know if Syndic even knows that he is still on the roster, cause a long time has passed since the Outer Rim Wars. Nevertheless Syndic visited the 5th fleets channel very regulary in the last 4 years, so he counts as active for all the time and so he gets promoted.
<br>It took a bit longer then our younger members, but you have earned it.
<br>Congrats Syndic.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Whitewolf</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Quejo Bandon</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br>Whitewolf is Lieutenant for more then a month now, Quejo for several months now, but with an outtime. Whitewolf took over the command over White Squadron from Commander Durgar of Korgath, Quejo got acting Squadron Commander in Phi Squadron after Captain Soniv Hope got Wing Commander. Both officers had been very active and present in the last month.
<br>Congrats Whitewolf, congrats Quejo.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Ensign Calista Fairbright</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br>Congrats Calista.
<br><br><br>More on that topic can be found here:<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=1229" target="mboard">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=1229</a>

<p class="textwhite"><b>11th November 2006: Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well, it's time for another Fleet Command report. Alot of changings happened in the last weeks, and a couple more are comming.
<br><br>A few promotions are done within this Fleet Command Report, but more promotions are already topic in the council. Wolverine got recently Jedi Master and on request of Fleet Admiral VDj Karper Captain Soniv Hope is hereby Advisor to the High Command Council.
<br><br>Friday evening (Very early Saturday here in europe) I had a meeting with the other Fleet Commanders or their representatives of the ORW Council about the ORW3. Rules have been decided on that meeting. The rules can be found of the wiki page:
<br><a href="http://wiki.rebelsquadrons.org/Outer_Rim_War_III">http://wiki.rebelsquadrons.org/Outer_Rim_War_III</a>
<br><br>Well, the council hasn't made a decision on how to replace Talon's Fleet Mission Run On, so we are up for applications. If you want to run a Fleet Mission Run On you should have some knowledge on the 5th fleet history and should post a small concept for the Background Story of the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br><br>I guess there will be given out some updates to this Fleet Command Report soon with some updates about the topics mentioned above.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Fleet Admiral Matt Sifi</font> is hereby promoted to High Admiral.
<br>I guess everyone in the fleet knows who Matt is, He is since years active now in the rank of Fleet Admiral and every visible on the gaming ladder, in RPGs, on the message board, in the channel, in the Order of Jedi and whereever you can see him.
<br>But a promotion to High Admiral, the highest corrent available rank in the 5th fleet, requires a bit more, and Matt done more then that. Over all the time Matt managed the communication of the fleet. If it is through the Fleet Message Board or through the Java IRC clients.
<br>Well, this is one of the few rare moments where someone gets promoted in the rank above Admiral and Matt is the 1st one that got high Admiral in the last 5 years.
<br>Congrats Matt.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Raul Jacknae</font> is hereby promoted to Commodore.
<br>Raul Jaknae is Captain for more then half a year now and proved himself as Wing Commander of the CRS Warspite and in the Order of Jedi.
<br>Congrats Raul.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Ash Halcyon</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br>Ash Halcyon is almost a month Lieutenant now and basically showed activity about all the time in several differrent activities, especially in the subgroups.
<br>Congrats Ash.
<br><br><b>Medals</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Ensign Xantos Sadow</font> gets a Medal of Communication for his 1st Message Board Post.
<br>Congrats Ensign.

<p class="textwhite"><b>19th October 2006: And More Medals</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Medals</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Talon Jade</font> gets a Golden Cycle.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Soniv Hope</font> gets a Golden Cycle.
<br>Captain Talon Jade gets the Golden Cycle for several subgroup services, Captain Soniv Hope gets the Golden Cycle for subgroup services and managing the latest Fleet Mission Run On.
<br>Congrats Talon and Soniv.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Soniv Hope</font> gets a Progress Coin for the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Commodore Wolverine</font> gets a Progress Coin for the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Commodore Gene Starwind</font> gets a Progress Coin for the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Raul Jaknae</font> gets a Progress Coin for the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br>Congrats Soniv, Wolverine, Gene and Raul.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Commodore Wolverine</font> gets a Jedi Honor Medal.
<br>Cause Commodore Wolverine already got a Golden Cycle for recent subgroup activities in the Naval Academy 3 days ago it didn't make much sense giving him a second now for his important role in other subgroups especially in the New Republic News. So he got a Jedi Honor Medal for his activity in the Order of Jedi but this medal counts also for his work in the NRN in the last months.
<br>Congrats Wolverine.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Fleet Admiral Matt Sifi</font> gets a Good Performance Award for the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Ash Halcyon</font> gets a Good Performance Award for the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br>Congrats Matty, Ash.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Commander Mike Skywaler</font> gets a Medal of Communication for the Fleet Mission Run On.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Whitewolf</font> gets a Medal of Communication for putting up his RPG Biography.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Commander Mike Skywaler</font> gets another Medal of Communication.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Ash Halcyon</font> gets a Medal of Communication.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Whitewolf</font> gets another Medal of Communication.
<br>Lieutenant Commander Mike Skywaler, Lieutenant Ash Halcyon and Lieutenant Whitewolf get the Medals of Communication for several smaller subgroup services.

<p class="textwhite"><b>17th October 2006: Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
You know I haven't been so much online in the last week cause real life kept me busy in the last time, ... as usual.
<br>
<br>Well there have been a tie in the voting for the next Run On between <b>Behind the Shades Chapter III</b> (Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson) and <b>Black Plague</b> (Captain Talon Jade).
<br>Instead of making a new vote I thought on starting both Fleet-Wide Mission Run Ons to give as many members as possible the chance to game master these run on missions so they are able to create their very own part of the 5th fleets history much more then they cn do as player of a run on. Sure it's a good chance for the career as well.
<br>
<br>Having two run on missions at the same time will be a quite difficult task for players and game masters.
<br>The fleet wide run on missions are usually more difficult then a normal run on. They have a time limit of 2 to 3 months so at the end of the time medals can be given out. One of 3 possible medals will be given out, a Medal of Communication for participation, the better players get a Good Performance Award instead and the best players get the Progress Coin. Cause of the time limit game masters need to proceed the story, even when the players aren't that far at a specified time.
<br>With two fleet wide run on missions at the same time it will be a bit more difficult to ensure the continuity. Captain Talon Jade's Run On plays in the timeline after Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson's Run On. So, in case someone gets promoted while the run on, this promotion can't be announced in Tax' run on cause he may have started in Talon's Run On, which plas later in the time line with the old ranking, same counts for destroyed ships or so. Or an ensign that gets newly asigned to a squadron, can write how he joins the squadron in Tax' run on, but in Talon's Run On he has to do a if he would have been in the squadron already.
<br>Well, I'm really curious to see if this project will suceed and if it isn't to complicated for the players to play in two different time frames at the same time. At least this will give roleplayers a lot of possibilities for gaming, especially with the time. For example a player could start in Talon's Run On with an injury and writes in the middle of Tax' Run On how he got it, or force sensible characters may have a vision in Tax' Run On of a scene that happens in Talon's run on.
<br>
<br>The ORW3 is still unclear. Most of you already read that Rear Admiral Lycah Fox, Rebel Squadrons Fleet Commander recently retired, so we wasn't sure what happens to the ORW3 project.
<br>Got a mail from Major General Jon Anchorage two days ago. The veterans in here may remember him as Captain Jon Anchorage who played massivly for the 5th fleet in the 1st Outer Rim War. Well, it looks like the Rebel Squadrons haven't given up the project, nevertheless the Republican Diplomatic Corps need to put up connections with the RS again to see details on the progress of the project and see if they need help from our side.
<br>Meanwhile there are also ideas from your favorite High Command Council to manage an own Inter Club tournament.
<br>I know many members are waiting for a long time now for the next Inter Club tournament, but organizing such an event isn't a simple task, especially when so many different clubs are involved.

<p class="textwhite"><b>27th September 2006: Short Fanfiction Competition</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>The Basic Premise:</b>
<br>All members of the New Republic Fifth Fleet are welcomed to write a short fanfiction based on the Star Wars universe. Stories can be set in any pre-existing Star Wars era (such as the prequel era, the original trilogy era, expanded universe era, and so forth). Stories may include the Fifth Fleet, but are not necessarily required to do so. The stories will be kept private until the due date, when they will be published online for all Fleet members read and rate via private voting system. The authors of the three highest rated stories will be handsomely rewarded. 
<br>
<br><b>The Specifics & Rules:</b>
<br>1. Stories must be fanfiction set in a pre-existing Star Wars universe era. No introducing new major content such as new races, force abilities, etc. 
<br>2. No length requirements. Please notice that the event is called a short fanfiction competition. Also consider what having an excessively long story or a paragraph long story will do to its rating. 
<br>3. Story plot and writing must be completely original. You may not borrow any plot content or writings from another author. Quotations of what an existing character has said in the past are acceptable. 
<br>4. All stories should be kept private until the rating begins. For the sake of your own creative privacy, do not share your stories early. 
<br>5. Edit and revise your story. Each member is only allowed to enter one story, so once you submit your story, it is final. No changes will be allowed. Stories will be posted on an as-is basis. I will not fix spelling or grammar issues, and I will not publish a story that grammatically or intelligently embarrasses the Fleet. 
<br>6. Stories should be e-mailed to Fleet Admiral Matt Sifi before October 11, 2006. If a story is not e-mailed by October 11, 2006, then it will not be added to the reading and rating list. 
<br>7. Once the stories are posted for reading, you must read them all if you plan to rate them. To rate one story, you must rate all of the stories and therefore you must read them all. You may not, however, rate your own story. (Example: I read all of the stories submitted. I rate all of the stories submitted, except my own story.) 
<br>8. Once the rating period is over, the results will be posted. The author of the highest rated story will be awarded the Golden Tournament Medal. The author of the second highest rated story will be awarded the Silver Tournament Medal. And the author of the third highest rated story will be awarded the Bronze Tournament Medal. 
<br>9. Above all, have fun doing this. Enjoy embellishing yourself in the Star Wars universe. Take time to relax and tune in to your creative and passionate instincts.

<p class="textwhite"><b>24th September 2006: Several Changes</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>New Fleet Mission Run On Comming</b>
<br><br>Well, soon Sonivs current Fleet Mission Run on should be completed and the medals should be given out. So It's time for taking applications from officers that want to run the next mission run on.
<br>Officers that apply should be at least one year in the 5th to know our structure and the rules for roleplaying.
<br>You can post here a small background for your story if you want to apply for game mastering one of those. Fleet wide mission run on means, it should be easy for everyone in the fleet to join the run on, even in later phases of the story.
<br>Maybe preparing for the ORW or other pre ORW isues could be a good storyline for the new fleet wide mission run on.
<br><br><b>Pin Changings</b>
<br><br>Well, I'm planning do delete some of the older cadet dossiers in the near future, of those cadets that haven't shown a lifesign for some months.
<br>These cadets are spreaded pretty much over the roster. I would like to fill some of these holes in the lower pin regions with active officers again to prevent loosing overview about the new cadets that join us.
<br>So if you like to have a lower pin please reply to this thread.
<br><br><b>Changings on Subgroups</b>
<br><br>Managing subgroups should be easier for the Directors of the different subgroups now. Put up a few hundret new code lines that enable to manage subgroups.
<br>A Director of the NAC, NRN, RDC or RnD can manage now, which officer has which position in his subgroup now. When the director logs in he should have a manage subgroup button that leads to a page where he can see the roster of the subgroup and can change the subgroup positions of the members in the subgroups.
<br>Director posistions surely can't be changed and cadet can't be added to subgroups as well, Cadets stay fix Student in the NAC till graduation.
<br><br>There is also a new button (Join the Order of Jedi) in the members administration area of all members higher then Second Lieutenant and not already in the Order of Jedi.
<br>So the is no need anymore to flood the OoJ board with joining requests. But Jedi Knights or Masters who take an initiate as padawan student.
<br>The requirement for Jedi Initiate has been increased to Lieutenant just to make sure that anyone that joins the fleet directly presses the button. Those officers below Lieutenant that are already Jedi Initiate or higher in the Order of Jedi like Second Lieutenant Whitewolf may stay in the Order of Jedi.
<br>If you experiance problems with the new features please contact me.
<br><br><b>Changings on Promotions</b>
<br><br>Well as mentioned in the last update there have been some changings on the promotion procedure. Wing Commanders and Carrier Captains do the promotions to Second Lieutenant, Lieutenant and Lieutenant Commander directly now.
<br>The promotions will be announced on the message board.
<br>Below there are still some promotions of junior officers, maybe the last I have done for some time, in case we don't get a promotion stuck again like in the years before.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Mavrik Steele</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant for reaching requirements.

<br>There are a couple of promotions to Second Lieutenants below, well, I wanted to have some of the promotions done since there may be a change in the form of the promotion to the earlier ranks. It won't get easier or more diffcult to reach the next ranking, just the form may change.

<p class="textwhite"><b>1st September 2006: Quick Update</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Name Convetions</b>
<br>Cause a couple of ppl have problems with selecting names in the last time I would like to explain the point.
<br>I guess the RPG members in the 5th fleet have less problems with that. But a couple of the gamers seem to have a bit a problem with this. The name is not only a unique idetifier for a member of the fleet, with name something is ment that can be used as name in RPGs and in announcements. Sure many members of the 5th fleet are more here for gaming, but even those may get mentioned in announcements, newsletters or the New Republican news or other things that are partly in character. It may also happy that those officers reach higher positions like Squadron Commander and Wing Commander and are at least mentioned in RPGs, Run Ons and fan fiction stories.
<br><br>So what are the rules for names:
<br><b>English Language</b> Usually Names start with a capital Latin letter, followed by a couple of Latin letters in lower case. That may sound stupid, but after a number of members signing in in ascii art or with Clan tags it's nessesary to mention it. This don't means a Japanese name isn't ok, it just need to be written with english letters.
<br><b>Unique</b> The name you choosed no other members of the 5th should use.
<br><b>No Star Wars Characters</b> Names like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo shouldn't be taken, usually this rules isn't seen strict for less known Star Wars Characters. Also names of Characters from other movies are not ment with this rule, so it's ok if someone takes James Tiberius Kirk as name or so.
<br><b>No Ranks</b> Military ranks, Jedi titles or other positional titles shouldn't be part of names. Darth is somehow an exeption since it's seen more as name compount here.
<br><br><b>Gaming Ladder</b>
<br><br>Gaming Ladder score board is up to date again, on missing games please contact me.
<br><a href="http://www.newrepulic.de/gaming/ladder.htm">http://www.newrepulic.de/gaming/ladder.htm</a>
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Garramercenary</font> is hereby extraordinary promoted to Lieutenant.
<br>Garramercenary makes a lot of communication on the message board, and he surely would have completed the requirements for a promotion soon, but cause of the recruits he made and the recruit that managed to pass the academy he got promoted earlier.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Queyo Bandon</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant.
<br>Queyo Bandon made an impressive amount of ladder matches in the last threee weeks where he is Second Lieutenant.
<br>Congrats Lieutenants.
<br><br><b>Medals</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Ensign Xpilot</font> gets a Medal of Communication for his 1st message board post.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Ensign Ash Halcyon</font> gets a Medal of Communication for putting up his RPG Biography.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Soniv Hope</font> gets a Medal of Communication for putting up his RPG Biography.
<br>Congrats everyone.

<p class="textwhite"><b>25th August 2006: Outer Rim War III</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Outer Rim War III</b>
<br><br>I guess a couple of you heard the rumors about the Rebel Squadrons planning the 3rd Outer Rim War. It should start in two months.
<br>For those that are new in the fleet, the Outer Rim tournaments are the biggest tournaments of their kind in the clubs around. Many of the important fleet around compete in this tournament.
<br>More about the ORW3 Project can be found here:
<br><a href="http://wiki.rebelsquadrons.org/Outer_Rim_War_III">http://wiki.rebelsquadrons.org/Outer_Rim_War_III</a>
<br><br>Well, the Outer Rim War will cause some changes in the planning. The Fleet wide campaign may be delayed after the Outer Rim War. So after Soniv's Mission is completed other members in the fleet have the opportunity to run a Fleet wide Run On mission. If you have time and you have an idea for a storyline for such a fleet wide mission please contact one of the HC members.
<br>The Campaign will start after the ORW then cause gaming is part of the campaign and that concentrates on the ORW during the ORW.
<br>The Training tournament with the Rebel Squadrons have been dropped cause of the ORW since there isn't enough time anymore. So we might do a 3rd gaming night before the ORW, but I need to check this with the council first. That will be another opportunity to get Tournament Medals. But the squadron commanders can also organize some smaller informal training sessions in the time between and the games can be counted as ladder games as well.
<br><br><b>Fleet Progress</b>
<br><br>Well somehow the fleet is running pretty well atm, better then expected, especially cause we have finally some experianced and active Squadron Commanders in the fleet. The progress of the fleet had been pretty slow in the last years, but meanwhile we are really recovering strength. A strength that hopefully results in a good placement in the ORW3 tournament.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Mike Skywaler</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br>Lieutenant Mike Skywaler is almost two month in his rank now, he was very active on the message board and in Run Ons in the two months.
<br>Congrats Mike.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Ensign Garramercenary</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant for reaching requirements.
<br>Congrats Lieutenant.

<p class="textwhite"><b>16th July 2006: Gaming Night</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Results from the Gaming Night</b>
<br><br>Well the gaming night was running ok, we had 5 individual players doing 15 games with 2 different platforms, Jedi Academy and Star Wars Battlefront 2.
<br>First of all I would like to thank everyone who played there but also everyone who tried to like Commander Soniv Hope or High Admiral Worf. Starting to return into regular gaming often isn't easy, members have to prepair their computers for the games, find their disks, and with all the platforms we support it isn't offen easy to find someone playing the same game.
<br>Sure, the gaming night might been seen small compared to the big clubs around, but I have also seen enough clubs where were high problems in getting back into gaming after a long time of concentration on roleplaying, who didn't manage that. I have played in many Inter club tournaments now, and we had often problems getting even 5 players to play on a saturday. So I'm retty happy with the outcome cause it shows that after more then a year of really low gaming we still have a solid base of gamers.
<br>Once again thanks to everyone who was there. Here are the game lists:
<br><br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 2 vs 130 InfestedPat 5
<br>JA: 130 InfestedPat 6 vs 161 Qui-Gon 10
<br>JA: 130 InfestedPat 4 vs 161 Qui-Gon 10
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 2 v 161 Qui-Gon 6 v 130 InfestedPat 10 v 001 GA_Simon 8
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 2 v 161 Qui-Gon 6 v 130 InfestedPat 10 v 001 GA_Simon 6
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 8 v 161 Qui-Gon 10 v 130 InfestedPat 9 v 001 GA_Simon 7
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 2 v 161 Qui-Gon 10 v 130 InfestedPat 4 v 001 GA_Simon 4
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 3 v 161 Qui-Gon 10 v 130 InfestedPat 6 v 001 GA_Simon 4
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 1 v 161 Qui-Gon 10 v 130 InfestedPat 6 v 001 GA_Simon 5
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 3 v 161 Qui-Gon 7 v 130 InfestedPat 10 v 001 GA_Simon 6
<br>JA: 006 Matt Sifi 6 v 161 Qui-Gon 10 v 130 InfestedPat 8 v 001 GA_Simon 4
<br>BF2: 001 GA_Simon L v Raul_Jaknae W
<br>BF2: 001 GA_Simon L v Raul_Jaknae W
<br>BF2: 001 GA_Simon W v Raul_Jaknae L
<br>BF2: 001 GA_Simon W v Raul_Jaknae L
<br><br>I have also thought on giving out tournament medals for the tournament depending how many merit points the got on the gaming night.
<br>Commodore Qui-Gon made the 1st place with 31 merit points shortly followed by Rear Admiral Pat with 30. On the remaining placed me with 21 points, Fleet Admiral Matt Sifi with 11 and Captain Raul Jaknae with 6 points.
<br>More on the medals below in the medals section.
<br><br>Depending how much time is left till the tournament with the Rebel Squadrons we are planning on a second gaming night already. So stay tuned on that channel.
<br><br><b>Changing in the Naval Academy</b>
<br><br>Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson retired after a really long term being the Director of the Naval Academy. Captain Talon Jade temporary taking over the Director Posistion till he knows if wants to stay in the job, otherwise we'll look for a new Director then.
<br>Well, I would like to thank Tax very much on the excellent job he did, maybe the most important job in the 5th fleet.
<br>Cadets in the academy could try to get in contact with Captain Jade already.
<br>A bit more on that below in the medals section.
<br><br><b>Run On mission over</b>
<br><br>Well the current Run On mission is over, cause Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson is in vacation over the next months. He will surely start a second Run On mission on a later date, that will continue with the mission here.
<br>I would like to thank to Tax and everyone that participiated.
<br>If someone had a storyline for the next mission or wants to host it, please contact me.
<br>Tax also gave me the list with the medals given out for the mission, more on that in the medals section.
<br><br><b>Medals</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Commodore Qui-Gon</font> gets a Golden Tournament Medal for the 1st place in the Gaming Night.
<br>Congrats Qui.

<br><font color="FFFF22">Fleet Admiral VDJ Karper</font> hereby gets a Star of Alderaan.
<br>Well, I have long thought about what a medal like the Star of Alderaan could be for. The medal haven't been given out for years. When Tax posted that he would retire from the Naval Academy I originally thought on giving him a Republican Service Medal. But thinking on my own words the Director of the Naval Academy is maybe really the most important position in the club. In the other subgroups we had often problems in leadership. Leading members changed often or got inactive. But welcoming new members, helping them with the exams and bugging them long enough till they start getting active in the fleet ever was essential in the fleet. I think having an officer like Tax in such a position that constantly overviewed the new members is worth a Star of Alderaan.
<br>VDJ got the Star of Alderaan cause of the same reason, he didn't got a similar medal when he resigned from the position.
<br>Congrats Tax, VDJ.

<p class="textwhite"><b>25th June 2006: Recruiting Campaign</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
In the attempt to get the some ships of the 5th fleet active again. I guess around 4 or 5 or 6 years passed since the last recruiting campaign. 
<br>Well, how does the recruiting campaign work. Well officers that recruit new members can get direct promotions besides the usual medals.
<br>Recruiting is not allowed in channels, message boards and gaming servers of other clubs. Recruiting is also not allowed in channels, message boards and gaming servers assosiated with other clubs (for example the #outerrim channel).
<br>An additional text field have been added to the joining form where new recuits can fill in the officer that recruited them.
<br>The recruiter gets a point as soon as one of the recruits passes the Naval Academy exam.
<br>Here is a overview about the promotions for recruits:
<br>1 recruits EN to 2nd LT (1 week)
<br>2 recruits 2nd LT to LT (1 week)
<br>3 recruits LT to LCM (1 week)
<br>5 recruits LCM to CM (2 weeks)
<br>8 recruits CM to CPT (2 weeks)
<br>12 recruits CPT to CMD (3 weeks)
<br>16 recruits CMD to RA (4 weeks)
<br>22 recruits RA to VA (5 weeks)
<br>28 recruits VA to AD (6 weeks)
<br>40 recruits AD to FA (7 weeks)
<br>(The time showes the minium time an officer is in his rank before he can get promoted to the next ranking. For example an officer got promoted to lieutenant commander one week ago and recruited 13 new members in the last week. He has to wait one week till he automatically gets promoted to Commander and 2 more weeks for Captain.
<br>There are also given some medals for the number of recruited officers. Republican Support Award for each 4 Recruits, Republican Service Medal for 10 Recruits, Star of Alderaan for each 30 Recruits.
<br>Recruiting entire clans or clubs:
<br>Well in case an officer can bring an entire clan joining the 5th surely each member of the clan counts as recruit, in case he isn't already in the club.
<br>The recruits of the last two weeks surely count for the Recruiting Campaign too, like Cadet Decot that has been recruited by Lieutenant Commander Walters, in case the cates pass the Naval Exam.
<br>It's not sure when the campaign ends, but recruiting numbers can ever count partially for a promotion. Like if an officer has more then half reached the normal service time required for the next promotion and has more then half reached the recruits reached for the next ranking, he surely can get promoted to the next ranking puting both results together. 
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Morrigan Jarel Jade</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant for reaching requirements.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Eton Jade</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant for reaching requirements.
<br>Well, usually officers get an extra week before they get promoted after reaching the requirements, but before the two Lieutenant completely flood the message board the lieutenants get promoted now. :)
<br>Congrats Morrigan, congrats Eton.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Ensign Mike Skywaler</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant for reaching requirements.
<br>Congrats Mike.

<p class="textwhite"><b>17th June 2006: Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well, I'm curretly working a bit on Battlegroup I things. Have made some smaller updates earlier this weeks concerning the archives:
<br>Some of the Run Ons have been placed in the Republican Archives:
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/tdwcamp1.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/tdwcamp1.htm</a>
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/tdwcamp2.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/tdwcamp2.htm</a>
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/tdwcamp3.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/tdwcamp3.htm</a>
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/orwstory.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/orwstory.htm</a>
<br>I guess a couple of you still remember on the TDW campaign last year, but maybe a few of you also remember on our first Run On we made in 2000.
<br>The second term 2005 is now completely in the medal database: 
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/medals.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/medals.htm</a>
<br>Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson is currently in contact with the Rebel Squadrons on a small gaming tournament. I'm sure he will post news on that topic as soon as he has them. The event with the Dark Brotherhood is still in conception since there are playing a big internal tournament at the moment it's surely nt the right moment to come with the campaign with them now. Later this year there are bigger chances.
<br><br><b>CCA and WCA</b>
<br>Well the Carrier Captain Award and the Wing Commander award have been changed a bit. Till nowthey were more thought for members in the fleet helping the Carrier Captain or Wing Commander in administrative issues like making pages. Well usually Golden Cycles or Republican Service Medals were given when officers create pages for squadrons and battlegroups, so giving them the same medals for making ship and wing pages should be ok.
<br>I have more thought that the Carrier Captain Award is now more used for a Carrier Captain to honor an extraordinary officer on his ship. The Wing Commander honors with the Wing Commander Award an extraordinary pilot of his wing. Wing Commanders or Carrier Captains can only give out the medal once a term. Officers can just award one of these medals per term. So an Officer can't get two CCAs a term, but he also can't get a CCA and a WCA in the same term.
<br>Well I have thought on changing that in two weeks when the ladder term is over so the medals aren't given out easily, but I have changed it now, so the officers of the fleet have more chances to get one of this rare medals.
<br>Till now just on CCA has been awarded one time i think and the WCA hasen't been awarded till now, so it's now real problem changing that medal a bit.
<br>Carrier Captains and Wing Commanders have a week now to think which members should get medals. It's up to them if they honor the best performance over the last half year or the best performance on their ship in general or whatever they think on their own on that medals.
<br>Well, this is one of the medals that is not given on an objective reason. There are medals that are given for a exact number of posts in a run on, for the best placed member in a ladder or an exact number of people recruited. This medal is given on the subjective view of a Carrier Captain or Wing Commander, so please don't complain in case you think someone else has earned this medal more. The medal is called Wing Commander award cause it's given out be the Wing Commander to an officer he thinks has earned it.
<br><br><b>Medals</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Talon Jade</font> gets a Golden Cycle for creating Eagle squadron banners.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Eton Jade</font> gets a Golden Cycle for creating Eagle squadron banners.
<br>Sure not the next 50 banners made get rewarded by Golden Cycle. Talon got the medal cause he put up a couple creativ things for his squadron before. Eton cause it was the first time he showed some arts created by him.
<br>Congrats Talon, congrats Etan.

<p class="textwhite">
<b>High Command Issues</b>
<br><br>Well, a couple of promotion discussions passed through the council, the results can be seen below. So a couple of topics have been unstickied. On the other hand there have been several discussions on chnages of the current fleet structures that splitted the council and that have been unstickied too.
<br>So the next time should be concentrated on organizing more and more interesting activities for the fleet members.
<br><br><b>Fleet Mission Chapter 2</b>
<br><br>Rear Admiral Gustafsson started the 2nd Chapter of the current fleet mission. It's open for the entire fleet to take part again.
<br>If you want to take part you can see the Run On thread here:

<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Commodore Mattias Gustafsson</font> is hereby promoted to Rear Admiral.
<br>Commodore Gustafsson is Commodore since 2005 now. He manages the Naval Academy Coruscant, has a lot to do on the Predator, is in charge of the Republican Diplomatic Corps, runs the current Run On mission, is often in IRC. Well, I guess it's really a problem finding a place in the 5th where Tax isn't present, so the entire High Command was for promotiong some many weeks before the stadant promoting time.
<br>Congrats Tax.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Captain Gene Starwind</font> is hereby promoted to Commodore.
<br>Captain Starwind own his rank since early 2006. He is a pretty present officer in the 5th fleet, if it is as commander of the Warspite, as player in several Run Ons or as Jedi Knight, meanwhile Jedi Master in the OoJ. In the last year he was ever someone to count on, when it came to campaigns and missions.
<br>Congrats Gene.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Commander Talon Jade</font> is hereby promoted to Captain.
<br>Commander Jade has his rank since mid 2005 now. In that time he was several month in the reserve and if often not really easy for his commanding officers, but in the time he is active, he is usually very active. He also brings often a couple of new members into the fleet, so he really earned that rank of Captain in all the time.
<br>Congrats Talon.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Nick Walters</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Ceradan Jade</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br>Both officers are Lieutenant for maybe a year now but got recently active again in the Eagle squadron. Lieutenant Ceradan Jade in administrative position as Vice Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Walters in the fleet run on. Additionally to the service they did before they got inactive it should be more then enough for a promotion to Lieutenant Commander.
<br>Congrats Ceradan, congrats Nick.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Ken Tatsujin</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant for reaching requirements.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Thes Nazud</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant.
<br>Second Lieutenant Thes Nazud is Second Lieutenant for a long time now. He had long phases where he was reserve officer but recently returned to active duty and should have been long enough active now to get promoted to Lieutenant.
<br>Congrats Lieutenants.

<br>Ensign Morrigan Jarel Wilder misses the requirements for Second Lieutenant just by a single post, but I guess it's ok promotiong her now instead of delaying the promotions for weeks.

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Fleet Roster</b>
<br><br>The new fleet roster is online. Basically the changes in the fleet manual have finally reached the roster. The design has also changed a bit.
<br>Here is a list of things that have been changed in the new roster:
<br><br>- Aviablility not to be asigned to a squadron
<br>- Adding the positions: Crewmember, Deck Officer
<br>- Adding HCC status to the profiles
<br>- Changing Subgroup Emblems (Different Emblems for different Positions)
<br>- Adding links to the descriptions of the different icons
<br><br>A few things haven't been added to the current version. Like the ability to have custom lightsabers.
<br>There are also a few minor changes on the being discussed in the HCC.
<br>So there may be some adjustments in the future, but I guess I will concentrate on different aspects of the fleet administration in the next time.
<br>The roster can be found here:
<br><a href="roster/index.html">http://www.newrepublic.de/roster/index.html</a>
<br><br>The new asignments made in the follwing thread are also on the roster already:
<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=876">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=876</a>
<br>But some of the ship discriptions still need to be made. The responsible officers that originally created the ships could contact me n that issue. Basically technical stuff should be in the discriptions, when constucted, when asigned to the fleet and so on.
<br><br><b>Reputation System</b>
<br><br>Well the squadron reputation has been reviewed. But there are still some discussions about making more fighter types aviable to choose. More on that topic here:
<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=893">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=893</a>

<p class="textwhite"><b>17th May 2006: New Fleet Manual</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
The new fleet manual has been put online. You can currently see it at:
<br><br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/manuals2/index.html">http://www.newrepublic.de/manuals2/index.html</a>
<br><br>It didn't replace the current fleet manual cause the academy courses are still referencing on the old manual.
<br>So the old Fleet Manual will stay until the courses have been modified so they are referencing the new fleet manual.
<br><br><b>Where did it start?</b>
<br>Well, what has changed, primary we have added the Crew Status to the fleet rules as it was discussed in the High Command Council and on the Fleet Board before. So officers don't have to be asigned to squadron anymore and officers that are higher then Squadron Comanders can't be asigned to squadron anymore. The changing is primary reasoned to make RPGs easier, so that officers that serve on the bridge of a ship don't have to be asigned to fly in squadrons at the same time. The other reason is to prevent double positioning, so that junior officers have real chances to get into higher positions. Usually a Carrier Captain isn't a bad choise for commanding a Squadron since he is usually high decorated, has much of experiance and the squadron has higher chances to get veteran or elite status. But even when a younger officer has less experiance for commanding a squadron then the Wing Commander or the Carrier Captain or one of the other officers in high positions, the younger ones should have at least the chance on triing if they manage these position and I guess the officers in high positions don' really lose status in the fleet when they give up their secondary or tertiary fleet position. I guess in the future we will think on dropping these double positions completely, but when the restructuration in done I guess we can think on a different primary project first.
<br><br><b>The first results.</b>
<br>Well, officers could be removed from squadrons that don't have other positions, but there need to be written something on the roster which position they have. So Crewmember and Deck Officer got added to the positions. Ok, someone asigned to a ship is a Crewmember, so adding Crewmember as position was pretty logical. But why has Deck Officer been added. Well Deck Officer is more thought for RPG purpose to display those officers that play navigation officers or ship doctors or characters like that. The Deck Officer don't has real funtions on managing a ship OOC, these positions are just there for RPG Purpose.
<br>There was also a problem with promotion abilities of Wing Commanders. Besides the Flagships where we had several wings, Wing Commanders were able to promote the entire crew of a ship ecept of the Carrier Captain, cause in a ship that has one wing every officer was asigned to that wing. When many officers would have been made Crew Member or Deck Officer the Wing Commander wouldn't be able to promote these anymore since they don't belong to the wing anymore. So the promotion ability of the Wing Commander have been changed in that way that the Wing Commander can promote everyone on his ship below the Position of Wing Commander now. (Well, that isn't very serious since all promotions currently going through the High Command Council and there is ever someone that is able to promote, but there were no intention to decrease the promotion ability of the Wing Commander so that has been adjusted)
<br><br><b>Other Changings.</b>
<br>Well the Fleet Manual, the Code of Conduct and the Fleet Compendium have been put together to the new Fleet Manual. The double parts (For example there were a Ranking Chapter in the Fleet Manual and a Ranking Chapter in the Fleet Compendium) were put together. The army rank references and the German translations for the ranks have been dropped from the manual. I guess noone really cares for the German variants anymore and the army variants just caused irritations. The ID Lines moved from Fleet Rule to Fleet Guideline (Have been moved to the additional topics). Sure both decisions concern Fleet Rules so can it be changed that easily without Council voting and discussing it with the fleet members. For the skipping of the German variants and the Army variants, they are still Fleet Rules. Some needs to translate Captain with Kapitaen and not with GrossAdmiral or Leutnant. They are just not written in the Core Rules cause they are technically not used too often. For the ID Lines, well the construction of the ID Lines didn't change. Since noone in the fleet really takes ID lines too serious, I guess supposed the fleet is ok by that. There is also an optical change of the subgroup emblems. There are differen emblems for different positions within a subgroup now. Jedi wear their Lightsabers as sign for belonging to the Order of Jedi now. Padawans have default Trainings-Lightsabers, Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters default Lightsabers too, but they will be able to have indvidual sabers when the new roster gets done. On the current roster the lightsabers are placed in the Personnel Items slot. Fleet Positions have Icons now as could be seen in the Preview too. The icons are more thought as graphical element for the profile pages.
<br><br><b>Comming Soon.</b>
<br>Well the next step in this progress will be adjusting the academy courses and redesigning the profile pages. I hope getting the roster done within the next weeks, but it may take longer.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Commander Raul Jaknae</font> is hereby promoted to Captain.

<p class="textwhite"><b>3rd April 2006: Structural Changes</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>The Crew Asignment</b>
<br><br>Well, this topic is going through the High Command for several month now. The basic idea was to be able to asign officers to ships without asigning them to squadrons automatically. Sure, this idea isn't new, but in the early times of the 5th when we have been basically a TIE Fighter clan such a structure wasn't really nessesary and the current structure was easier. Cause we are going more and more into Roleplaying there have been a couple of thoughts on changing this structure.
<br><br>How would that change the structure in detail. Well basically everyone on a ship could be asigned to the Crew of a ship instad of being asigned to a specified position within a squadron. There are no limitations for the numbers of crew members asigned to ships. While a Small Calamari Cruiser can only have 2 squadrons so 24 pilots, it can have several hundret crew members.
<br><br>Fleet Commander, Fleet Executive Officer, Fleet Senior Officer, Group Commanders, Carrier Captains and Wing Commanders automatically get crew status. I guess I don't need to explain that in a battle the place of the captain is on the bridge but something familiar counts for the Wing Commander. Not in each case it's better to organize the flight opperations of 72 fighter from a cockpit. For the RPG games and Run Ons Wing Commanders and officers with higher positions can still lead squadrons from their personnel fighter with ids like Red Zero or so.
<br><br>Well a consequnce of this change would be that a couple of younger officers would get the chance on making the first step into the fleet administration, cause a couple of squadron command positions that are hold by wing commanders and officers in higher positions would get free.
<br><br>Besides the officers in high ositions, which officers could have crew status too. Well that's basically up to the captains of the ships. Inactive members and reserves could be set as crew, as well as officers with admiral rankings that don't think they want to be pilots anymore, but basically that's up to the captain and the officers how they want to organize that. There is also a possibility to give those officers crew status that have ship titles like tactical officer or ship doctor.
<br><br>This is one of a few concepts that went through the fleet command. But I don't know exactly when I'll implement it into the roster database, so there is some time for all members in the fleet to have the chance to protest against the changings in case they don't like them especially since the projects requires to change he basic fleet rules so each member has to be heard on that project.
<br><br><b>Personnel Things</b>
<br><br>Well, I have been less often in the fleet channel and on the fleet message board then in the las months. Just want to remind if you can't catch me in case of promotions, changings on the roster, decisions on tournaments and asignments to positions you can contact the Fleet Executive Officer (High Admiral Commskywalker) and the Fleet Senior Officer (High Admiral Worf) too. squadron.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Commander Destavol Gin</font> is hereby promoted to Commander.
<br>Lieutenant Commander Destavol Gin has his rank for a really long time now. He wasn't that active in the last time but in his active months as Lieutenant Commander he has more than enough for a promotion to Commander.
<br>Congrats Destavol.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Durgar of Korgath</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br>Lieutenant Durgar of Korgath has showed a lot of activity in Run Ons in the last few months, een in a time where the activity of the rest of the fleet was pretty low.

<p class="textwhite"><b>1st March 2006: 8th Anniversary</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
8 years have passed in the life of the 5th fleet; some things changed, some things stayed the same.
<br>The 5th fleet started as TIE Fighter club, went from X-Wing versus TIE Fighter and X-Wing Alliance to Jedi Knight. 2002 to 2003 we played massivly Jedi Outcats and Jedi Academy after that time. It's pretty pity that Battlefront didn't reach the popularity but I'm looking positive towards Empire at War.
<br>We started in the Empire with a hand full of Imperium Stardestroyers before we build up Executor Class Superstardestroyers. TO show our superiority we build the Eclipse Class Superstardestroyer Dominance. But our arrogance brought us the destruction and we traveled through the community without destination. But out of the ashes of the Imperial 5th the Republican 5th fleet grown. Times passed where we started repairing our ships and our souls. When the Rebel Squadrons called us to the Outer Rim to fight their war against the empire again we returned into battle. Starting with the remnants of the Stardestroyers of the Imperial 5th we build up a new fleet with growing numbers of Mon Calamari Cruisers. After many years of battle we returned to a more quiter phase, but times may return where we shown our skills and our honor to our friends and our opponents.
<br>We have started as newbees with pages where html-tables with backgrounds in different colors represented the fleets, where the first mods for games were hacked into hexadecimal code with scary DOS editors and where images with 256 colors took ages to load. We didn't won many of the early battles, but we got stronger in the Inter Club Tournemants. Noone mentioned when the early message boards was down for days and now we have Run On threads with more then hundret replies.
<br>... just my English didn't got better in all the time.
<br><br>Like in the years before we have a small meeting today at 22:00 CET (21:00 GMT, 16:00 EST). We can talk about some topics or just listen to the grass growing. Maybe we can do a small Empire at War tournament or at least some ladder games, depending how many ppl will be there. Like in the years before there will be a anniversary medal. Just wish the fleet happy birthday in the message board thread here in the next 48 hours. Maybe we are also counting appearance at the meeting for the medal, but to be sure it's better you post here anyway.
<br>Well, happy birthday 5th fleet.

<b>Empire at War</b>
<br><br>First of all for those who don't know what Empire at War is, you can look here:
<br><a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swempireatwar/indexFlash.html">http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swempireatwar/indexFlash.html</a>
<br><br>First of all Empire at War will be counted to the ladder games and like every Startegy game with double merit points. I'm sure they will play it at the ICTE too.
<br>If 4 or more players in the 5th should start the game we can surely make a elimination tournament. If we have 3 members maybe a round based torunament is better, we'll see that when the game is out and some of the members have already bought it. Surely there will be given out tournament medals for such an event.
<br>High Admiral Worf mentioned that it's possible to create own campaigns in EaW. Sounds interesting, we could bring up the battle medal system for the old TIE Fighter campaigns again and instead of TIE Fighter members complete custom 5th fleet Empire at War campaigns.
<br>I'm sure there are a lot of other possibilities that could be thought about, maybe some inter-club. I guess we'll see that soon.

<p class="textwhite"><b>20th January 2006: Future Gaming Events</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well, it's really time we get into a gaming event in the near future again. I know I have posted that before, but usually when I'm asking for new ideas I usually just get response from a few well known officer, but I would like especially the younger officers to take part in this kind of brainstorming.
<br>The situation is the following, before the 5th fleet returns into big business, I would like to see our capacities in gaming, if we have 5 or 50 players. Surely we have 50 players on the roster and many of them played in one of the tournaments in the past, but in case we do a tournament it could be usefull to see how many of them would return into gaming, or start with gaming.
<br>I'm sure, if we would start with ORW3 many of the veterans of the first two wars would play, just to remember on old times when we were strong enough to challenge the big clubs around. But I would like to start with an opponent that is a bit smaller then the Dark Brotherhood to see how many officers are interested in geming in general.
<br>And that's the point where I need the ideas of junior officers of the 5th fleet. Not only the basics need to be discussed but also the gaming details like which games are played, how do the games get scored, how do the games get displayed. You can post your ideas as reply to to the thread on the Message Board.
<br><br>Just a small addition, I have finally fixed the error with the display of the Star of Valor.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Commander Gene Starwind</font> is hereby promoted to Captain.
<br>Captain Starwind has served a long time in the 5th fleet in the ranking of Commander, all the time surely in the top 5 of the most active officers in the 5th.
<br>Besides his activities in roleplaying and in the Order of Jedi, he also did a lot of administrational things as Carrier Captain of the CRS Warspite and is pretty visible in the 5th fleets IRC channel.
<br>So I have to honor to be the first on gratulating you on your new rank Gene.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Davor Jurist</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Durgar of Korgath</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant.
<br>Both officers served several weeks to months in their rank and shown a pretty good activity in the Run Ons on the Message Board.
<br>Congrats Lieutenants.

Reviewing Vice Admiral Stuart's profile I mentioned that he didn't got one of this medals till now.
<br>I know it's a bit late but congrats Stu.
