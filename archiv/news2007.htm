<p class="textwhite">
<i>Arial was looking over the reports she was going to show Michael.
<br>
<br>"The reports of the last years, Arial?" he was asking.
<br>
<br>"Yeah, you just need to sign them."
<br>
<br>Michael was checking some of the topics from the reports and finally signed them.
<br>
<br>"I'm wondering what the naval command needs that ancient stuff for."</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>Well, finally got the history together I had maybe half a year on my desk. The form resulted from the discussion in the High Command half a year ago.
<br>Till now we didn't have a clear connection between real time and starwars timeline, before we said we are 8 years past endor, later 9 years. before and around 'Darksaber'.
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/index.html">http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/index.html</a>
<br>
<br>The history section are divided into 3 parts. The first part is white and cursive. It's about the general Star Wars history in the timeline. The normal white part is the 5th fleet specific history in that time. The grey parts are additional informations and OOC things.
<br>
<br>It's not complete at the moment, especially the Star Wars history, but also the 5th fleet specific history. If you have ideas or comments on the history or if you have something to add, feel free to reply to the message board post.
<br>Additions should have a higher fleet relevance and should have some historical logic (Renaming ships, upgrading shiptypes, removing ships after two months of service don't happens so often in reality.)

<p class="textwhite"><b>29th September 2007: Imperial Stardestroyer Immortal</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
On special wish of Commander Whitewolf the news get posted on the main page again:
<br>
<br><i>Several command officer of the 1st Battlegroup of the 5th fleet were standing on the bridge of the Version 3.2 Imperium Class Stardestroyer Immortal, overviewing the damages of the last battle. Dozends of tugs and smaller transports were fliing like bees around the hull of the warship. The reactor had been close to a meltdown and was shut down then, it was irrepairable damaged so teams were starting to isolate the reactor core while others were mounting a small mobile reactor on the bototm of the ship to have enough energy for a hyperspacejump to the next shipyard.
<br>The Immortal had a few other damages but nothing serious, at least noting as serious as the replacement of the reactor that would take some months.
<br>Grand Admiral Simon was talking to Admiral Andries and a few other while he noticed a smaller almsot unimportant explosion on the upper hull. Michael mentioned loosing weight and suddenly he started difting upward extremely slow, like the other officers on the bride.
<br>"Sir, we have a problem with the gravitation generators." one of the officers on the bridge reported.
<br>"I guess we mentioned that already, Lieutenant." Admiral Andries replied.
<br>"Knowing my luck life support if failing in the next 5 minutes as well." Michael mentioned.
<br></i>
<br>We had long time the problem of getting new recruits for the Immortal, and now with the retirement of Admiral Andries from the position of Carrier Captain, it'S a problem keeping this ship online at the current state. Officers from the Immortal will be transferred to other Ships in the 1st Battlegroup. If you like to get transferred to a different ship not in Battlegroup One, please sent me a private message on the message board. Soniv, HIgh Admiral Commskywalker and High Admiral Matt Sifi mentioned offering you higher psoitions on their ships, you could contact them, and there are 3 Wing Commander positions on other ships, so you could contact me or the representive officer on that.
<br>Sad to reduce Battlegroup One by a ship again, 2 ships remaining from 10 planned ships. Maybe at the later point the battlegroup can be expanded again, but currently it more usefull not spreding our new members on too many ships.
<br>
<br>Another point are roster updates. We have a lot of promotions for long timers below. A few other adjustements on the roster have been made, misisng medals added and so on.
<br>The changes on the ISD Immortal will be made as soon as I have lists from the officers of the Immortal on which ships they like to get.

<p class="textwhite"><b>3rd June 2007: Some Updates</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well, as mentioned in my latest report, the Fleet Command Reports will get a bit rarer these days. This one should have been release almost a week a ago, but i didn't found time for the lastest medals of the campaign. Hopefully finding some time for that in the next days.
<br>
<br>So the campaign is over. Pretty much a sudden end, usually I have concepted an additional chapter with a major strike against Horus, but the time the campaign took has been pretty long now, and after some time there is some need for a break, to give out medals and start new RPGs where members can play with their ranks they have earned meanwhile and new members can join easier. Captain Skywaler had asked the council end of 2006 for starting an own Fleet Mission Run on, but this got skipped till after the campaign, so I guess it's time for him to start now. Also if there are applications for the second FMRO please contact me or one of the other council members to bring it up to the council. You could add a small description what the story is about.
<br>
<br>Well what is a Fleet Mission Run On, for those who have joined us in the last few months. Well a Fleet Mission Run On is a Run On with a limited time, 2 to 3 months, there are medal sets given out for the participiants and the FMROs need to get green light from the council.
<br>A Fleet Mission Run On should be designed for everyone in the fleet to take part. Well it's not nessesary that every ship needs to take part in the storyline. So if the captain of a ship wants to take part that don't automatically means the entire ship is part of the mission, but there should be a way to include each person in a FMRO, maybe a visitor, of observing Jedi, or temporal transfer or whatever, so everyone in the fleet has the possibility to play in the FMRO from the beginning on.
<br>
<br><b>Order of Jedi</b>
<br>
<br>Well cause the Jedi are pretty popular in the last time I would like to write a few lines about it. When the 5th fleet started we didn't have a Jedi Subgroup or Sith Subgroup, not even when we turned sides. At some point the Order of Jedi got build not to give addtional activity to the fleet. It has never been concept of the subgroups to divide the fleet into several group that have seperated activities and are just losely affiliated with the other parts of the fleet. No the OoJ got build cause of the need that we would have got problems having every Ensign plays as Jedi Master. So the OoJ got build to have an overview on who has which Jedi title and later who has which force powers and so.
<br>In the campaign it got pretty much visible, with a couple of Ensign Jedi Masters this could have been without real difficulty to play against the Phantoms.
<br>Well, this is an RPG and if someone wants to play a Jedi Master he should be able to do it, the prblem is, most of the members don't act as lightsiders, some even worse then us ex-Sith. Also I'm expecting from Masters of the Jedi to act more wise then others.
<br>Another point is that a battle with a Sith is the ultimate challange for a Jedi, at least it's like that in the movies, and that a Sith is usually a more deadlier fighter than a Jedi of the same level. I don't really expect someone here loosing a dual against a Sith, but add it as final combat in your RPG, and don't slice through them as if they were battle droids.
<br>That's the reason for the padawanship, to learn how to play a Jedi like a Jedi.
<br>Sure there have been problems with getting enough trainers for Padawans, but we have 3 trials running, maybe one comming soon. So there should soon maybe less problems for initiates to get padawan. I can also talk to the masters that those who were active in the initiates thread and/or are long time Initiate have a shorter padawan time then, but the master has the last decision on that.
<br>Finally there is some change with the lightsabers. You can see on the profiles yourself. Knights can select a few different sabers now, Masters have some additional selections (Two sabers or Dual bladed saber). Something similar existed in the old roster, but meanwhile there is a form to change the lightsaber. You can access it through you member management page.
<br>Have made single sabers to Knights and Dual saber or Set of two sabers to Masters cause I thought I remenbered the latest decision of the OoJ was something like that.
<br>The changes on roster pages have been made a week ago, the pages for changing the sabers two days later, for those of you who have already mentioned that.

<p class="textwhite"><b>5th May 2007: Some Updates</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well, I usually wanted to give out a Fleet Command Report not before a few days, but there are some issues that need to b talked about.
<br>
<br>Well, the non comissioned RPGs are usually not as restricted as the Fleet Mission Run Ons, they don't have medal sets, but on the other hand everyone can start such a run on, they aren't limited on time, and they don't have restrictions on god modding, continuity and timeline as the other run ons if the game master or thread starter don't wishes that.
<br>But there are some limitations for these Run Ons as well, less in fix rules, but more in common sense.
<br>Would like to thank High Admiral Matt Sifi and High Admiral Worf pointing me on these issues and handeling them.
<br>
<br>Usually I wanted to add a paragraph about honor here. But I guess most of the newer members would be bored by this. Nevertheless, it could help even for the quality of the story to face opponents who are more playing in the league of the character you developed.
<br>
<br>
<br>Ensigns Zack of Death, Ohen the 3rd and Fushigi are hereby asigned to White Squadron on the Mon Calamari Cruiser Warspite.

<br>High Admiral Matt Sifi also recently brought the fifthnet.org online with the ability for commanders to bring their own unit pages online.
<br>Both should be worth to be honored with the highest medal of the 5th fleet, the Star of Alderaan.
<br>Congrats Matt.

<p class="textwhite"><b>15th April 2007: Hunting the Ghost Phase III</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well, once again a more or less short Fleet Command Report. Eastern has kept me a bit busy. There were also a few things in the fleet going on meanwhile.
<br><br>First of all the second phase of the Hunting the Ghost campaign is completely over now with the end of the Predator Battle Run On. The medals for that Run On have been given out below, the medals for the short story contest should follow in the next days.
<br>The Run On for Phase III has already started some weeks ago, but I hope it's getting into the hot phase soon.
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1372">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1372</a>
<br>Some important notes on the Run On can be found here:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1290">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1290</a>
<br><br>Commodore Thes Nazud recently brought up that Position Icons could be added to the uniform. He has also made an example for this with his own uniform:
<br><a href="../../i37.photobucket.com/albums/e79/thesnazud/ThesNR5F1.gif">http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e79/thesnazud/ThesNR5F1.jpg</a>
<br>Who likes to add his or her own position emblems on the uniform can do it simmilar. Sure this counts for the green Alliance uniform like in the exaple ad for the pilot suits, not for the Imperial grey uniform or the ceremonial white one.
<br>Well, Thes isn't this first one mentioning adding position emblems to the uniform. In the Imperial times we had cylinders showing the positions of the members. They have been dropped when we turned to the Republic to make uniforms simpler. Also for the Imperial uniforms position cylinders have been dropped.
<br>In the years after the a couple of members came with the idea of position emblems on the uniforms, but with the possibilities of having 3 or 4 fleet positions at the same time besides the subgroup positions and the g´high fluctuation in some of the positions it didn't really make sense in adding position emblems to uniforms.
<br>Position emblems on the Alliance Uniforms stay still optional. So if someone prefers not to add his or her positon emblem on the uniform he don't needs too.
<br><br>Thes' uniform also shows pretty good how to add Lightsabers to an uniform.
<br><br>Well, I got a couple requests  and messages in the last two weeks, and I will take time in the next days to reply them. Usually I'm not formulating too fast, I guess it took me more then 4 hours just to formualte the simple report here and make the changes on pages and database resulting through it.
<br><br>Also High Admiral Matt Sifi gave out some ship reports and added copies to the Message Board:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1433">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1433</a>
<br>They are very good exmples how such reports could look like, even when weekly reports are pretty much more regulary then I have expected. :)
<br><br>Like in the last reports, there is a couple of more activities, events, medals and promotions on the way. Still waiting on the point where the stack of paper on my desk is getting a bit smaller again.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Commodore Gene Starwind</font> is hereby promoted to Rear Admiral.
<br><font color="#ffff22">Commodore Wolverine</font> is hereby promoted to Rear Admiral.
<br>Commodore Gene Starwind is in his rank for almost a year now, Commodore Wolverine for 2 month less then Commodore Starwind. Both show excellent performance in their command positions and in case of activity. Commodore Wolverine recently put a lot of efforts in the New Republican Naws and into the Outer Rim Tournament, so he was able to catch up with Commodore Starwind and both got promoted to Rear Admiral.
<br>Congrats Gene, Wolverine.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Captain Soniv Hope</font> is hereby promoted to Commodore.
<br>Captain Soniv Hope is much more then half a year in his rank, he is Director of the Reseach and Development and Wing Commander of the ISD Immortal. He showed pretty regular activity in the IRC channels, message board, in roleplaying and in command discussions.
<br>Congrats Soniv.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Second Lieutenant Liedan Aish</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant for reaching the requirements.

<p class="textwhite"><b>29th March 2007: The end of the 3rd Outer Rim War</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
The 3rd Outer Rim war has ended last weekend with the withdrawel from the Dark Jedi Brotherhood.
<br><br>Well, I would like to speak on some write a small paragraph about it. In my oppinion the 3rd Outer Rim War didn't reached the quality of the earlier wars. Well, there were a couple of complaints about the earlier ways to submit scores and and the lack of a bot matching the right ppl together. There had been complaints on the scoring and the exeptions from the basic rules. Sure a couple of problems, but nothing too serious.
<br>But what I specially dislike was, that the system didn't encourage players that aren't exactly top players to play in these tournaments, cause sooner or later they find out that loosing damages to position of their club in the battle and will stop playing. I guess we have seen that pretty drastically on the last day.
<br>I think we had a great team in this tournament, not only our own team also the fraction. But a couple of our good players spend their time with waiting on opponents. And I have seen tha in other fractions too that good players were waiting long time for opponents.
<br><br>Finally I would like to talk about our very own problems in this tournament we didn't manage to encourage our newer members to play in the tournament as well. Besides Lieutenant Commander Solander just Commodores and Admirals took part. I guess we had the most veteran team in battle, and they did well. Sure most of our newer members concentrate on Roleplaying, but for comming competitions we need to manage to get newer members into battles as well.
<br><br>But enough of the critique, it's time now to honor those members who fought for our fleet in the 3rd Outer Rim War. Maybe we only had half of the participiants we had in the 1st Outer Rim War, but those who played showed courage and team spirit like in the olders wars. And I guess the huge amount of medals below speaks for itself.
<br><br><b>New Republican News</b>
<br>High Admiral Matt Sifi stepped down as Director of the New Republican News and Commodore Wolverine followed him Director of the New Republican News.
<br>Commodore Wolverine had also been in charge for the ORW Times while the 3rd Outer Rim War with some help of Commander Mike Skywaler and realeased the March issue of the 5th Exploits:
<br><br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1403" target="_mboard">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1403</a>
<br><br><b>New Medal Released</b>
<br>Besides the 5th Fleet ORW3 Honor Medal another new medal has been issued, the Hero of the Tactical Command medal. The medal will be given out four oustanding deed in strategy games.
<br><br>Pretty unusual that this medal got released cause I doubt there will be many of them given out in the next years, nevertheless the council favored that medal. Well from now on only new medals will be issued that have a good chance to be given out often enough in the time after the release.
<br><br><b>Vice Admiral Pat gets Golden Pilot Wings</b>
<br>Vice Admiral Pat upgraded his silvern to golden Pilot Wings for 100 games played in the 3rd Outer Rim War. He got the first Pilot Wings awards since the Celestrial Fury 3 years ago.
<br><br>A couple of officers had reached 20 games, the requirement for silver pilot wings, but they already had silver pilot wings or better.
<br><br><b>Small Research and Development page</b>
<br>I have added a small page for the Research an Development subgroup. I hoped getting a small page for the New Republican News done as well, but it may take some longer. I'm still thinking about the design.
<br><br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/subgroup/rnd.php">http://www.newrepublic.de/subgroup/rnd.php</a>
<br><br>Some notes from myself. In the last weeks you have experienced a massive amount of medals given out. And sure there will be an amount of medals again when the campaign ends. But of cause there will follow a time where medals get more rare again. Well it's not the idea of medals to collects tons of them to show how much you dominate. Well it's more the idea that you look back too years ago and remember you have got that medal cause you fought in the Outer Rim War or cause you have been there when the fleet celebrated it's 9th birthday. To be true, who of us that reached 5 or more Medals of Communication still remembers each one he got, and what is the meaning of a medal if you don't even remember yourself.

<p class="textwhite">
First of all, sorry this is going to be an interlude Fleet Command Report again. The ORW3 is still going on, even if the participation dropped to 40% to 30% percent of the weeks before. The Imperials have left the tournament and with only 2 fractions remaining the concept is pretty much damaged.
<br>So the medals are still given out, when the tournament ended, but some of the promotions are done now as I mentioned last week. A couple of promotions are still on discussion in the High Comamnd Council
<br>Important for the players of the ORW3, before you play cotact either High Admiral Worf (Darth Angelus) or High Admiral Matt Sifi
<br>
<br>Sorry I have forgotten to mention this last time. The medals for the Behind the Shades Run On in the lst Fleet Command Report are surely from Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson.
<br>
<br>Well, ladder score board is up to date again with a couple of JO results from High Admiral Worf, High Admiral Matt Sifi and Rear Admiral Pat:

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Outer Rim War III</b>
<br>
<br>Well many of you know about the current standings of the 3rd Outer Rim War from the updates on the message board. In the 1st two weeks the Rebel fraction got 2 times the 2nd place and one time the 3rd place. Basing on this results this may be the mid of the tournament and we may get throw out of the tournament in the next 3 weeks.
<br>Well, I have posted on the message board already that there isn't too much time left, for those of you that still want to get the ORW3 medals for participation or the silver pilot wings for 20 games in a single Inter Club Tournament. In the past thime there weren't too many chanches to get silver and golden pilot wings, so this is a pretty unique chance to earn this honors and may be able to get your squadrons a Veteran or Elite squadron with the fighter upgrade.
<br>
<br>Till now 9 members of the 5th fleet have taken part in the 3rd Outer Rim War. The current scoreboard for the tournament can be found at:

<br><b>Hunting the Ghost Campaign</b>
<br>
<br>The second phase of the campaign has started one week ago. The Battle Run On for the VNSD Predator has already started a week ago, but may still need some additional players. The gaming night for phase two will be on saturday from noon EST to midnight EST. Games can be arranged in #new_republic on dalnet and on undernet. These games count for the ladder as well, so there are no additional medals besides the tournament medals, cause you earn medals points on the ladder as well.
<br>High Admiral Matt Sifi may also release the short story competition in the next time that will go till the 15th march. And if we get enough players for the IRC RPG toegther we'll do that as well before the 15th march.
<br>
<br>Around the 15th march the 3rd phase of the campaign will start with a large Run On for everyone again that will proceed the storyline.
<br>

<p class="textwhite"><b>1st February 2007: Outer Rim War III News</b></p>

<p class="textwhite"><b>Outer Rim War III</b>
<br><br>The 3rd Outer Rim War has begun, well technically just this weekend, but I can almost smell burned TIE Fighter hulls, well hopefully not ours. IRC channel is #outerrim on undernet. Those of you that have played in the Outer Rim War before, know how things are going. You signup in there for a specified platform and for a team game or 1 on 1. You get matched against an opponent player that signed up for the same platform. You can make a game then, the winner gets reported. Both sides gain points for their teams, and you can signup for another match.
<br><br>Counting in the 5th will be a bit different then in other clubs. You get one merit point for making a game and if you win the game you can get an additional merit point. There will be a table of merits you get getting specified amounts of merit points. There will be a tournament medal again everyone gets that participiates in the tournament. The difficulty for pilot wings will be increased: 20 games for silver pilot wings, 100 games for golden ones. Reason is, you have much more time to get a game. They kinda trippeled the time where you can signup for games since ORW2. In ORW2 weekends were 9 hours long, in ORW3 you have almost two complete days. Also the number of gamers should have increased. SO getting games and playing many games should be much easier then in the ORW2.
<br><br>Medals of the ORW3 will be given out as always at the end of the tournament.

<br><br><b>Medals again</b>
<br><br>Well, I have got a list of medals from Tax for the last Fleet Mission Run On. Originally wanted to add them to the roster, but I'm thinking on changing the roster data base a bit, especially cause there are 3 new medals comming out soon(campaign medal, ORW3 medal, anniversary medal) plus the Blue Medallion and I have thought in increasing the Jedi Honor Medal from Battle Medal to Special Honor Medal.
<br><br>Well, currently there are a couple of other fleet tasks on my task list besides that, so I may take some time till the next medals appear on the roster.

Well, the campaign will fully start on Saturday with the start of the battle Run Ons. On friday everyone can write how their ships jump into hyperspace. On Saturday if everything turns out right I will put the starting threads for the two Rattle Run Ons online.
<br>Once again a reminder, please turn off your signatures when posting in the campaign Run On threads.
<br><br>Also ORW3 seens to start soon. The first test has been made last weekend. Second Lieutenant Vladek Solander already played for the 5th fleet there. The ORW3 may start at the 3rd February.
<br>I'm a bit occupied with the campaign at the moment, so I may need a few officers that don't only play at the Outer Rim, that also observes the tournament keeps the fleet up to date and motivates our members to play. I' thinking on giving out Golden Cycles up to Stars of Alderaan for these officer, depending on effort and of course the outcome for the 5th fleet.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>

<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Commander Ash Halcyon</font> is hereby promoted to Commander.
<br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Commander Quejo Bandon</font> is hereby promoted to Commander.
<br>All three commanders showed continous activity on the message board and in different Run Ons. The details on the activities differ a bit and maybe the promotions could been a few days between the three promotions, but out of efficiency and cause the Battle Run Ons start this weekend all three promotions are done today.
<br>Congrats Thes, Ash and Quejo.
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Second Lieutenant Vladek Solander</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant.
<br>Usually not even Second Lieutenants that fullfill the requirements for Lieutenant get promoted exactly after two weeks and Lieutenant Solander missed the required message board submissions by far. But the Lieutenant shon an outstanding performance on IRC where other new members are often discouaged by the lot of people idleing in the channel or the technical difficlties of Dal.net and he also shown an outstanding performance for a lieutenant in the challenge with the other clubs in the #outerrim.
<br>Congrats Vladek.

<p class="textwhite"><b>8th January 2007: Hunting the Ghost</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Well to the statistics of the 2nd term 2006 weren't too bad. In the ladder we had 19 players getting 66 mdals for playing in 106 games. Besides the ladder we had 44 indivudual members decorated with 120 medals.
<br>The ladder medals are meanwhile on the rosters and the statistics can be seen at: <a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/ord2006.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/ord2006.htm</a>
<br>Well around one third of the medals were awarded for ladder gaming, that would be usually a good quote, but the reason was more, that we didn't had an Fleet Wide Campaign or Inter Club Campaign or Inter Club Tournament in the last time which is usually the major source for activity and so the major source for medals.
<br>As mentioned in the last Fleet Command Report we'll try to start the campaign soon.
<br><br><b>Hunting the Ghost Campaign</b>
<br><br>Basically the campaign continues where the last ended. The Imperial Remnant Warlord Horus is still fighting against New Republican reglar forces in the Outer Rim. The 5th fleet will open a second front on thhe opposite site of Horus' controlled Territories.
<br>The campaign will proceed in the following way. We start with 3 Run Ons. One normal Run On to proceed the storyline and two battle Run Ons.
<br>In the Battle Run Ons the Carrier Group Predator and the Carrier Group Warspite will face an oponent not told ATM. All three Run Ons should be done within 6 weeks, and the GMs of these Run Ons should mae a post at least every week to keep the story proceeding. There will also be an experianced player playing the Imperial Remnant side to make the story more dynamical.
<br>Phase Two will be a small interlude with a Gaming Night an a Short Story Competition that hopefully wil be hosted by High Admiral Matt Sifi.
<br>Phase Three will be a Run On similar to the Run On in the last Campaign. We will try to include IRC RPG again. So before the Run On reaches a special scene, the Run On gets stopped for a day. At this day the scene can be played in an IRC RPG and after the RPG the Run On Continues.
<br>The Phases after Phase Three are not determined till yet, I guess we will see, in the development of the Campaign.
<br><br>Participation problem. First of all I may need some Game Masters, at least for the two Battle Run Ons, experianced Run On Players taking over the Imperial Remant Parts in the Battle Run Ons and maybe some Judges for helping me deciding on medals and other aspects. Officers interested in one of the jobs please contact me. Best via private message of the message board.
<br>Well, I hope we have enough Run On players for both battle Run Ons. If not we may have to scratch one. So please everyone who might be able to Run On playing make a reply to this post. Also Pilots from other ships can be asigned to both ships in the battle Run Ons. So If you are asigned to another ship but still want to take part in one of the battle Run Ons please reply here too.
<br><br>Ladder gaming is again part of the campaign, in a much more usefull way at the moment. Carriers have limited resources now. Lets take the Warspite for example. It has a cargo load or 1400 concussion missles, 1000 torpedos and 6 squadrons so 72 fighters/bombers. Well a torpedo run on an enemy target can cost 100 to 200 torpedos per squadron depending on the fighter/bomber type. If the Warspite sends 5 squadrons against an opponent target it will loose maybe 50% of the loaded torpedos.
<br>Well after a battle a Carrier needs new figters and ammunition and resources are limited in the region where we are opperating. So each ship has an amount of resource points that can be spent on refilling weapons and fighters.
<br>For solving Phase One ships get resource points, but also for getting it's members gaming in the ladder. Or for good results in the Short Story Competition, or for good results in the Gaming Night. Also, opponents get more dangerous in the later Phases of the campaign. There better weapons are required like Mag Pulse Torpedos or Snifflers.
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="FFFF22">Lieutenant Commander Mike Skywaler</font> is hereby promoted to Commander.
<br>Lieutenant Commander Mike Skywaler has his rank for several month now and were active over all the time. Especially on the message board he is one of the most active members of the 5th. Was about time for the promotion.

<p class="textwhite"><b>1st January 2007: Happy New Year</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Happy New Year everyone.
<br>Thought it would be a good idea starting the new year with a Fleet Command Report.
<br>There is a large to do list below, well, we can see what can be accomplished in the next weeks.
<br><br><br><b>Some changes on medals</b>
<br><br>Well there are some smaller changes on medals that will be done. Well the number of medals given out kinda increased in the last time for stuff besides gaming and roleplaying.
<br>I have given out some performance medals in the last time or confimed such medal sugestings, and I have seen others giving out these medals as well. It's not my indication to flood newer members with lower medals. Even if the attraction might be higher, it didn't really led to a draft in the roleplaying or gaming sections and it's just not the style of the 5th. Better to give a more important medal after a time when officers earned it.
<br>So performance medals will be given when officers leave a position (surely not in case of getting the next higher position, like leaving Assistant Director to get Director in the same subgroup. When someone leaves his position he usually gets a general honor medal for the work he did into his job, sure the importance of the position and the length he did it are important, but especially in lower positions the quality is an important factor too. In case of positions in the OoJ Jedi Honor medals can be given as well instead of general honor medals in and in the NRN the Crimson Award for News and Informations.
<br><br><b>Blue Medallion</b>
<br>The Golden cycle had a higher value before. To restore the value again the Golden Cylcle will be splitten into two medals: The Golden Cycle remains the higher one and the Blue Medallion will become the lower version. To make sure the Blue Emblem don't gets massively given out in the next medal term, the medal can't be awarded more then two times by a single officer in the first medal term of 2007.
<br><br><b>Leadership Award</b>
<br>The Leadership Award is an aged medal that has been given out in the first Inter Club Tournaments but haven't been used in the last years. I have thought on reviving it for the Run On scene. So the Game Master of a Fleet Mission Run On can give out this medal now to the best player in a Run On. This medal is given additionally to the Progress Coin the player gets but the game master can't award this medal to himself
<br>(By the Way there won't be given a extra medal for the game masters anymore. The get a Progress Coin like the best players in their Run On. I guess most officers that have enough experiance for Game Mastering a FMRO have meanwhile enough Golden Cycles anyway.)
<br><br><b>Jedi Honor Medal</b>
<br>The Jedi Honor Medal will be given out for a concret reason now. Will be given to a padawan that finishes his training. It can be given to the master that trained the padawan as well. The medal can also be given out if an officer retires from a position in the Jedi Council. Other resons for giving out this medal are reserved to the Fleet Command Council.
<br>The Jedi Honor Medal is indeed a bit low medal to give it to a Padawan after several month of training, but don't forget the Padawan gains the title of Jedi Knight with the corresponding rights for completing the training, the medal is just a bonus.
<br><br><b>Crimson Award for News and Informations</b>
<br>This medal will be given out for the 1st time an officer releases 3 issues of the Newsletter or is represented in at least 6 issues with at least one quality article. You can only award the CANI one time for this reason. Means, you don't get 2 CANIs for 6 released issues, but you can get additional CANIs for other reasons and the CANIs you got before don't count in here.
<br>This rule counts back till the Halloween Edition of the Fifth's Exploit, so Commodore Wolverine gets the CANI for realeasing the 3 issues below.
<br>The CANI can also be given when officers in higher positions of the NRN leaving their position after a long time, usually not for members retireing from lower positions and also not for ppl that aren't too long in the NRN.
<br>The Fleet Command Council surely reserves to give out the medal for other issues related to the NRN.
<br><br><br><b>Competitions 2007</b>
<br><br>Well, last year we have thought on a couple of tasks that cold be done and didn't happen then.
<br>Campaign was though to be made, then we thought on gaming with other clubs, we started thinking making a battle with the DB, then a tournament with the RS got offered and we dropped the campaign idea and the event with the DB, then the RS dropped the tournament when they started to plan ORW3 again, and so we laft 2006 without a great tournament or campaign, well this will change in 2007, hopefully. I'm thinking on starting a internal campaign again, regardless if ORW3 starts or not. It should start short after the end of Tax's FMRO. CUrrently looking for some veterans (Commodore or Higher) playing the role of opponents in Run Ons and IRC RPGs. I'm also planning to make the campaign in different chapters so new joiners have it easier to get into it while the campaign is already running. Like the last campaigns this campaign should cover all aspects of gaming and roleplaying again, if we can accomplish that we will see.
<br><br><b>Inter Club Training Event</b>
<br>Well, recently got contacted from Sith Warrior Karel Bruth`Kothae from the Dark Jedi Brotherhood.
<br>He noticed noone of the 5th fleet played in the Inter CLub Training Event in the last time, so I wanted to remind everyone on the event.
<br>The ICTE takes places saturdays one undernet in the channel #outerrim. The typical gaming medals get awarded, but they are a bit easier to get then in the ladder, cause matches are usually a bit shorter and you have more opponents to play with. Another advantage is, that you get the medals directly, instead of waiting till the end of the ladder term. It also counts as primary activity for your promotion.
<br>Sure there are also several strong players in the ICTE, but you get medal points for loosing as well.
<br>Most of the actual Star Wars games are played there, Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy, Battlefront I/II, Empire at War ..., but make sure you have downloaded the newest official Lucasarts patch for the game you want to play.

<br><br><br><b>The Ladder Term</b>
<br><br>The Second Ladder Term for 2006 is over. If you have more results for 2006 you can mail them to me within a week, but you need to write to me that these results are for 2006 otherwise they will be counted for the 1st ladder term 2007.
<br><br><b>Medals</b>
