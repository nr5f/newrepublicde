<h1>Into the Darkness Part II: Taking the Hill</h1>

<p class="text">
Grand Admiral Michael Simon was watching the smaller ships in front of the Prometheus moving into hyperspace in the Sara Sepentis Delta star system. Zarathos, the capital of the Horus' controlled territories, wasn't really far away. After the jump the entire fleet left hyperspace again, ship per ship.
<br><br>Few moments later Michael was standing in the cathedral of the Prometheus, with the commanding officers of the Prometheus, as well as the holograms of the commanding officers of the other parts of the fleet.
<br><br>"We should have left hyperspace closer to the planet, Michael, they seem pretty much unprepared for our attack, could have been an easy task." High Admiral Commy stated.
<br><br>"You're right, Commy, but I guess it's not the worst idea, giving them some time sorting their chaos over there. We have maybe 150, maybe 200 freighters and transports fleeing from the planet, maybe most of them are out of the way before we reached the zone." Michael replied.
<br><br>"Who say this are civil transports, Horus could be in one of them, or maybe something else important." Cormmy returned.
<br><br>"Well, I have expected at least 2 super star destroyers here, this chaos here and the lack of defenses indicates that he has already left the place. This isn't the 1st price here, if we solve the situation here fast we may be able to get a second try.
<br>Primary objectives are to gain the military superiority in the orbit of the planet without any civil casaulties and with a minimum of own losses." Michael stated.
<br><br>"By the way, did you notice that Golan 3 station just leaving the radar shadow of the planet?" Commodore Thes Nazud noted.
<br><br>"A Golan 3, how they heck did they get something like that here?" High Admiral VDJ Karper replied.
<br><br>"Ok, targets are the group of 4 stardestroyers, the Golan 2 in front of the planet and the Golan 3 behind it.
<br>Angelus, you have the most ships. I would suggest you are taking out the stardestroyers." Michael stated.
<br><br>"Should be possible." High Admiral Angelus returned.
<br><br>"Try to demobilize them instead of taking them out completely, maybe they are usefull later." Michael mentioned.
<br><br>"Ok Zentar will take the Golan 3 then, leaving the Golan 2 for Battlegroup One." Commy said.
<br><br>"That's been decided then. Don't forget to instruct your officers to avoid civil ships or transporters that at least seem to be civil ships. And try to avoid losses, our real opponent is somewhere else, and we need to be at fully strength to confront him. Even if that means that opponents escape." Michael said.

<p class="text">
"Launch Cruise Squadron immediately to search for Golan 3" ordered High Admiral Commy the moment the holotransmission ended.
<br><br>Arriving on the bridge and looking up at the computer displays, Commy was immediately given a status update. "Sir," squeaked a relatively nervous Lieutenant, "Cruise Squadron reports visual confirmation on Golan 3, no fighters have been launched."
<br><br>That means they have something planned. Barely any fighters have been launched from the planet yet, thought Commy. "Order the Warspite to follow directly behind us, all squadrons are to engage in a defensive perimeter around the Battlegroup, and be ready to break on my go. Begin heading towards the station in two minutes."
</p>

<p class="text">
After arriving onto the command bridge of the ASD Prometheus from the cathedral of Prometheus, were Grand Admiral Simon just gave out a debreifing to all commanding officers from the Prometheus and the officers from the 5th Fleet. Rear Admiral Skywaler looks over at tactical and scans computer displays. Seeing that Cruise Squadron from BB Zentar has already found the Galon Three station.Hmm thats odd Mike thought as he read the lastet tactical information that came from the Zentar about so far the enemy forces has not yet lunch fighters from the Galon Three station or planetside.
<br><br>"Launch Kappa Squadron immediately to search for Galon station two." Mike ordered the Flight Officer for Flight Group Three.
<br><br>"Yes,sir!" replied the young Lieutenant.
<br><br>a few minutes later
<br><br>"Sir, Kappa Squadron reports visual confirmation on Golan 2." Lieutenant Deanna Dark told Mike.
<br><br>"Good lunch the remainding fighter squadron of Flight Group three and have them defensive perimeter around the Battlegroup and the Prometheus..Also have flight crews prepair my fighter just in case I need to join the battle and help the pilots out in dogfights." Mike replied to the Flight Group Three Flight Officer.
<br><br>"Aye,sir, orders recived.!"
<br><br>Rear Admiral Skywaler nods at the young beautiful Lieutenant and walks over to Grand Admiral Simon.
<br><br>"Grand Admiral, Fighter Wing Three has been lunch and been ordered into a defensive perimeter around the Battlegroup and the Prometheus..Also before the remainding fighters were lunch..I had Kappa Squadron lunch first and they report a visual confirmation on Golan 2 near the northern pole of this planet..What are your order,sir?" Rear Admiral Skywaler said in a claim voice as he spoken the the Commanding Officer of 5th Fleet.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</p>

<p class="text">
"The Golan platform is launching TIE Avengers and there are a handful of TIE Fighters" Michael replied "But the reinforcements from the planet will need a few minutes till they reach the station, should be enough time for a first assault against the station. Split your wing into two waves, the 2nd wave should consist of bombers and a few escorts for the assault, the 1st wave should clear the way for the 2nd one, especially those Avengers. You can request reinforcements from the 2nd wing if nessesary. The battlegroup will proceed to the station in the mean time."
<br><br>Michael turned his head for a second listening how Vice Admiral Wolverine ordered his brother letting the Hamburg fall behing to intercept a group of corvettes moving towards the battlegroup. Then he continued talking to Rear Admiral Skywaler.
<br><br>"Avoid getting your wing between the station and the incomming fighter groups from the planet, before they get in range have your wing return to the battlegroup and regroup with the other wings here."

Nervous about the upcoming battle, Lieutenant Commander Ory is sitting in the cockpit of his X-Wing. Gripping the flight controls, James closes his eyes and looks out into the hanger. Anxiety is coming in and these are the days he wishes he was a Jedi just to get rid of the pre-battle jitters. With his R2 unit "Chrome" sitting in his slot, James is dressed in his pilot jumpsuit with his helmet sitting on top of the control board.
<br><br>"I don't know...I have confidence we'll win, but our last stand could cause us to lose a lot of good men. It's my duty as a pilot of the New Republic to protect my fellow pilots and men. I just hope I can complete this mission with the same going for everyone else."
<br><br>Looking out into the hanger, James eventually nods off into a light sleep. For some reason his X-Wing relaxes him and not his quarters.
</p>

<p class="text">
"Understood, Admiral" Mike replied to Grand Admiral Simon the Fleet Commanding Officer and Mike's old Jedi Master that trained him to become a Jedi Knight.
<br><br>Mike turns and walks over to the crew pits and to his Flight Officer Lieutenant Dowel.
<br><br>"Lientanent Dowel, reply these orders to my wing."the Rear Admiral looks down at the Lt.Dowel who was looking back at him waiting for the orders to reply to his fighters," Golan platform has launched TIE Avengers and handful of TIE Fighters from their hanger bays..Kappa Squadron,Flight group three from Lambda Squadron, and Omega Squadron your task is to destroy any Imperial Fighters that come into your cross hairs..You guys will be dealing with taking out those TIE Avengers and handful of TIE Fighters..The rmainding flights from Lambda Squadron, Mu Squadron, and Nu Squadron..Your task is to protect MU squadron from any Imperial Fighters that get pass Kappa Squadron,Flight group three from Lambda Squadron, and Omega Squadron..MU squadron you already know what you have to do..Blast them to kingdom come...Also keep in mind there are incomming fighter groups coming from the planet..So hurry up and disbale that station,destory its fighter wing and regroup with the other wings in this battlegroup.!!"
<br><br>"Orders sent and confirmation from the squadron leaders that they understood the orders that you gave them,Admiral." Lt.Dowel informed Rear Admiral Skywaler.
<br><br>"Good.!"
<br><br>Some Five minutes later Rear Admiral Skywaler's fighter wing from the ASD Prometheus completed their task but lost Flight groups three from Omega Squadron and Kappa Squadron after dealing with the Galon defenives, and it fighters. The fighter wing return just in time to regroup with the other wings in the battlegroups from 5th Fleet, before incomming fighter groups coming from the planet got into range of Galon.

<p class="text">
The warships of the 5th fleet were slowly moving into attack positions into the weapons-range of their targets. While the first wave of Republican fighters started on the first tasks the main contigents of fighters were about to start.
<br><br>The remnant of warlord Horus defenses had meanwhile organized their defenses. Nearly 300 TIE Fighters, TIE Interceptors, TIE Bombers and TIE Avengers had started from the bases on the planet to support their fleetmates in space. The small fleet opposing Battlegroup meanwhile went into shard formation the two ISD building head and tail of the formation, the two VSDs into the remaining positions.
<br><br>And while the maijority of the fleets were moving into positions the first of their squadrons had already started fighting. 
</p>

<p class="text">
The flashing lights and the alarm in the hanger awoke James from his cat-nap. Breathing heavily, the Lieutenant Commander awaits further orders to launch. Looking around him, he sees the pilots from flight group III manning their fighters. Smiling, James knows that they will get the job done. All that needs to happen now is to follow Auric 1-1 out the hanger and then help with the spearhead assault on Warlord Horus.

"Looks like it's their turn now." Michael said counting the red colored TIE Bomber emblems on the radar.
<br><br><br>On the bridge of the Prometheus everyone seemed busy organising the carrier group. The Hamburg XII was covering the back, but the opponents were comming from the front. The Prometheus was just minutes away from reaching the weapons range of the Golan station, the first challange of that sort the Prometheus was confronted with.
<br><br>Vice Admiral Wolverine indentified the icons on the screen and moved towards Rear Admiral Skywaler. "We have 4 groups of TIE Fighters and TIE Bombers incomming and less then 2 minutes to intercept them. Your wing in the only one in range, you have to take them out."
<br><br><br>Meanwhile on the Predator Rear Admiral Thes Nazud made an announcement through the speakers everywhere on the ship and in the fighters. "To every pilot on the Predator. We have a large number of hostile bombers comming from Vektor 37.3. All orders are withdrawn as long as this threat for the ship is still out there, shoot these buckheads down."
<br><br><br>On the bridge of the Zentar Vice Admiral Raul Jaknae shouted towards his Wing Commanders. "How did this bombers manages to break through our lines, take them out."

Vice Admiral Wolverine indentified the icons on the screen and moved towards Rear Admiral Skywaler. "We have 4 groups of TIE Fighters and TIE Bombers incomming and less then 2 minutes to intercept them. Your wing in the only one in range, you have to take them out."
<br><br>"Yes,sir" Rear Admiral Skywaler replies to Vice Admiral Wolverine who just walks over to him after indentified the icons on the screen." "Lientanent Dowel, new orders for fighter wing three...They will engage at will because we have 4 groups of TIE Fighters and TIE Bombers incomming and less then 2 minutes to intercept them..Its up to them destroy those fighters and the bombers that just break through our lines from Vektor 37.3 and Vektor 37.2..They must take them out now before they reach the main ships of this fleet."
<br><br>"Orders sent and confirmation,Admiral." Lt.Dowel informed Rear Admiral Skywaler," Is there anything else,sir?"
<br><br>"Yes, there is have my personal fighter ready for combat..I'm going ot help my fighter wing destroy those sorry sun of guns." Mike informed the Lieutenant and faced Vice Admiral Wolverine. " Vice Admiral Wolverine,please keep me posted on whats going on,sir."
<br><br>"I will, Mike, go show those Imps what you can do behind a TIE Interceptor equied with shields." Wolverine replied.
<br><br>Mike salutes both Vice Admiral Wolverine and Grand Admiral Simon who looked over at him. Which Mike just gave a look to his Master the look that told a thousands of words and his Master understood and let him leave the Command Bridge. So Mike could board his TIE Interceptor and blast some Imperials to another galaxy.

"All fighters, launch immediately! Multiple contacts spotted in vector 37.3! Contacts confirmed as TIE Bombers. All fighters, launch immediately! Multiple..." Hearing this, James blasts away with his squadron out of the flight deck and into the darkness of space. Leaving the calm of the hanger bay and into the fray of battle, Lieutenant Commander Ory is given the order to break off and find their targets.
<br><br>"Alright! Wildfire, SK, lets prove that the X-Wing is still a useful fighter!" Aurics 3-1, 3-2 and 3-3 form up into a daggerhead formation and begin to target and destroy TIE Bombers. "These things are slow! Easier than punching a Hutt!" The rest of his flight group chuckle over the comm as they begin their assault.

The giant SSD Angel of Darkness had encountered the small fleet of Stardestroyers meanwhile. The stardestroyers and almost two dozend smaller ships ahd almost surroded the SSD and were triing to get the ship down, but the Angel had a lot of firepower, unfortunatly the Imperial remnant had twice the fighters and bombers out there then the entire Battlegroup Hunter and reinforcements from the planet were incomming.
<br><br>High Admiral Worf was taking a look on a tactical map showing the situation around the Angel. He was pointing on an icon on the display and speaking to one of the bridge officers.
<br><br>"This is Auric squadron, what's their current task?"
<br><br>"They are interecepting bombers moving towards the Predator."
<br><br>"Auric is a good squadron and they are placed excellent. Contact them, they should complete their task fast and make and assault on the bridge towers of the two stardestroyers on the right side. Coordinate the gunners of the Angel with them, they should give a broadside against the stardestroyers to take theit shields down so Auric can strike their bridge towers."
<br><br><br>The prometheus had proceeded into range of the golan platform and both contrahents were shooting on each other. At that time Wing 3 had managed to take out some bombers and fighters of the two outer groups of attackers and the others were in dogfights with the fighters of the wing, but the two innger groups used the time to slip through the defenses and the first wave of torpedos had launched against the Prometheus already.
<br><br>"Mike." Vice Admiral Wolverine was calling into the microphone. "Take those ships of your wing closer to the Prometheus, regroup with the Avengers from Epsilon squadron and take down this two groups."
<br><br><br>Battlegroup Zentar has also started their assault against the golan 3 platform. The first wave of fighters defending the station had been taken out pretty fast cause they were seriously outnumberd, but the remnants sent a lot of reinforcements there from the planet as well.
</p>

<p class="text">
After coming out of the tallon roll and blasting the TIE Fighter he was chasing which stayed out of Mike's cross hairs for a good two mintues before Mike nailed him. Before Rear Admiral Skywaler was going to excaute his next maneuver he heard Vice Admiral Wolverine updata and orders. Which he repled them to his fighter wing and releaved Kappa Squadron and Omega Squadron because he order them to follow him. So they can regroup with the Avengers from Epsilon squadron to intercepte the two innger groups that had used the time to slip through the defenses and the first wave of torpedos to launched against the Prometheus. Which Mike could see through his cockpit that the Prometheus sheilds were holding, as he brought his TIE Interceptor into range of packet of TIE Bombers.
<br><br>Not long after Mike's TIE Intercetor,Kappa Squadron and Omega Squadron had meet up with Epsilon squadron above and near one of the two innger groups near Promethues port side.
<br><br>"Ok,boys pick your targets and let them have it!!!"
<br><br>Mike order his men and women in the Kappa Squadron and Omega Squadron as he goes into the Jinking maneuver into the resvers thrttel hop after he locks on a TIE Interceptor that was about to close in on Rear Admiral Ash Halcyon Darkstar Squadron X-wing Fighter. Its not going to happen buddy..nice try thought Mike thought as he pulled the trigger on his joy stick and let lose a vally of greens lasers into the enemy TIE Intercetor and watch it explode.Have a nice day Mike pulled to the left on his joystick to bring his TIE Intercetor 180 degrees to the left so he can conduct another Tallon Roll or perform a Feint and backstab maneuver with his fighter wing to deal with this innger groups that they had out smart him and his fellow officers on the command bridge of the ASD Prometheus.

<p class="text">
"Good work Aurics! Now head towards those Star Destroyers!" Hearing that on the comm-link, James takes his flight group and rejoins the rest of the squadron. The nine X-Wings in the squadron fly in a arrowhead formation.
<br><br>"Auric 1-2 and 1-3 on me. Auric 2-Lead take your squad and join up with Auric 3-Lead. You guys are going to draw the Star Destroyer's fire and take some fighters off our tails. We'll take it one at a time, we can't rush things."
<br><br>Nodding, James takes his flight group and joins Auric 2 and flies closely to the other X-Wings. "Alright, Wildfire you're on me. We'll distract the gunners, nothing better than shooting at the best pilots in the fleet. SK, I want you to distract some of the fighters, if it gets too hot Wildfire go in and assist. Let's not disappoint Grand Admiral Simon!" 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commander James Ory</p>

<p class="text">
After Mike, the pilots from Kappa Squadron, Epsilon squadron and Omega Squadron destoryed the final flight group of TIE bombers that had manage to break through his fighter wings lines near the galon station that Prometheus was still pounding away blasting the station apart. After listening to the com chatter on the channels he pulled his TIE Intercetor into a tight break maneuver to close in on a TIE fighter that closing on Commander Ory's X-wing fighter. Mike wasn't going to allow this Imp blast his friend to space dust. From Mike's cockpit view he watch Commander Ory zig zag to shack off the TIE fighter, not long after the Auric pilot realized he had a boogy on his tail. When Mike had a lock on the enemy fighter and let lose of green laser into the eye ball,then switch his com fequicny for a quick sec to Auric Squadron.
<br><br>"Commander Ory, I thought I taught you better than that..Watch your back..I won't always be there to save you butt next time,Commander..Please watch you back, Admiral Skywaler out."
<br><br>Mike did a quick wing salute to Commander Ory with his TIE Intercetor left solar panel wing,before disengage from the Auric Squadron pilots side to pick another TIE fighter blast.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</p>

<p class="text">
"Heh, I owe you a drink then Admiral. Thanks." Barrel rolling, James takes the rest of his flight group and flies around the bridge tower taking some pot shots at the turbolaser towers. "Auric 3s, watch yourself we got a group of TIE Fighters heading our way." Pulling shields back to double aft and front, James speeds towards the TIE Fighter. Two of the fighters are engulfed in red flame as two of the X-Wings blow away half of the fighter complement. Spinning his fighter around, James' X-Wing dodge green fire as he returns red laser into the cockpit of the TIE.
<br><br>"Shield Generators on the first ISD are taken care of, moving on to the next one." is announced over all comm-frequencies.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commander James Ory</p>

<p class="text">
Ion cannons on the SSD Angel of darkness quickly disabled the shieldless ISD while the turbolasers shredded a VSD apart on the other side, Predator and payback were pushing ahead to increase the pressure on the opponent fleet. High Admiral Worf and Admiral DG Karper were watching the scenario from the bridge.
<br><br>Battlegroup Zentar had almost won the fight against the Golan 3 station. Shields were down and less then half of the weapon systems of the platform were still opperating while the bulwark battlecruise still had 50 percent energy in the shield systems. But the number of enemy fighters had been increased drastically. So HIgh Admiral Commskywalker had to send out all his squadrons to defend against their arracks.
<br><br>In the meantime Battlegroup One had taken out the weaker Golan 2 station and the first waves of incomming bombers. Grand Admiral Michael Simon had left the operations central 'Cathedral' again and had returned to the bridge. On the bridge Vice Admiral Wolverine already waited for Michael.
<br><br>"Just a matter of time till we have the capitol defenses of the planet down. Maybe the numbers of bombers are shrinking or they are holding them back, but they have twice the fighters out there we have." Wolverine reported.
<br><br>Michael agreed: "Looks like it's up to our pilots now, winning the battle."
<br><br><br>Exept of the fighters which had twice the number of the Republican ones the opponent had been beaten. Michael didn't want to risk more fighters in this combat, this wasn't the end of the campaign, more the beginning. They would need their squadrons later. He ordered those squadrons not helping the other battlegroups back into the hangars of the Prometheus and moved Battlegroup I into position for an orbital bombardement. The capitulation from the military leadership of the world followed soon, Michael had expected some more resistance from the world and that they had to blast some planetary weapons or military bases first. This time the victory was fast, and maybe pointless. No signs of the giant ship yards that had produced Horus' fleets. Or all the factories. At least Michael had the feeling that warlord Horus had accidently left behind a hint leading to him.</p>
