<h1>Hunting the Ghost (Phase One)</h1>

<p class="text">
<b>Phase I</b>
<br>
<br>In the orbit of Delasol was much traffic these days. Ok Delasol was a world with a pretty large population, so there was ever much traffic. But today it was more then usual. Almost hundred larger freighters had been parked in the orbit of Delasol, surrounded by the warships of Battlegroup One. Food, fuel, ammunition and several divisions of ground forces were loaded into this fleet of freighters.
<br>
<br>Battlegroup Zentar was summoning near Coruscant. They have had a mission there and High Admiral Corran Horn used the spare time after the mission to give large parts of his crews vacation time on Coruscant. Now they were collection all these people in again, cause the battlegroup was supposed to move to the Republican space station in the orbit of Alpharing III.
<br>
<br>Battlegroup Hunter was meanwhile clearing the area around the Alpharing system from pirates. Not that there were too many pirates, but it was better to clear the area before sending a convoy of almost hundred freighters into the area.

Mike was sitting in his x-wing looking over scan reports from his wingman and his astromech. Well Mike was in the last three battles with pirates in the Alpharing system. Which he survive all three battles along with the other squadron of VNSD Predator. Looking back at the reports making up his mind on the information.T hen Mike sent the the information to the Predator of the scan report of this sector. After sending the report Mike got on the squadron com channel to order part of the squadron that was out with him back to the landing bay.
<br>
<br>"Ok, Aurics lets head home and get some down time before we get orders from Fleet Admiral VDJ Karper and Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson."
<br>
<br>"Copy that, Commander."
<br>
<br>Mike end the transmission and turned his x-wing around towards Predator. The flight to the hanger bay was boring and tiring to Mike while he got clearance from Flight Control.
<br>"Flight Control, This is Commander Skywaler, permission to land in Auric Squadron landing bay."
<br>"Commader Skywaler you have the clearance to land."
<br>"Thanks control."
<br>Mike eased the x-wing through the hanger doors and putting down the x-wing near the Cobalt Squadron landing area.Which Cobalt and Auric Squadrons landing areas are so near each other because of the Predator's big flight deck. Shutting down everything in his cockpit and stepping out from the cockpit down the ladder from the long patrol.After getting out of the x-wing Mike went to his quarters to get some sleep and eat some food in the Predator galley.

Michael was in a conference room in the Imperial superstructure on Delasol that was former the Imperial Command Nexus of the planet and got the seat of the planetary administration after Delasol turned to the Republic. There were a couple of other former Imperial officers in the room. Fleet, Battlegroup and Carrier Group Commanders from all kind of Fallen fleets and groups, together with a few Fallen Generals, almost all of the clones.
<br>
<br>"You're sure you get as close to Horus as you mentioned?" One of the admirals asked Michael.
<br>
<br>"Don't know. But well there is at least a chance. And I don't want to be this time as unprepared as I had been last time ...
<br>Well I need to be on the Prometheus in half an hour, if there is nothing else we may see each other within a few weeks."

Raul had been on Yavin IV for the last few weeks, working with his padawan Quejo on the training that he was receiving. He had thought his apprentice was coming along nicely, and if, perhaps, he saw some action in this coming troubles, he'd feel he was ready to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight. It would, of course, depend on how he handled himself under extreme pressure. However, that was kindly in the back of his mind as he brought the borrowed Lambda class shuttle to a landing post, after a sweep of the skies over Coruscant. He knew that the bustling capital had more than enough security for any three planets, but it did his mind good to be flying again...and doing patrols occasionally. It kept his senses sharp, and his mind quick. The docking ramp was let down as he stepped into the air, the Jedi Knight pulling the hood of his robes over his face, concealing it from the world. He wasn't trying to hide himself...rather he was trying not to announce himself. He wanted to check the news flashes and the holovids to make sure that there was not anything he should know about. He also wanted to check to make sure his orders hadn't changed. The best way was to do that on the ground, instead of receiving them from space...after all, transmissions could be spliced...and the information could be taken easily.

Could be seen in actual republic officers clothes as he handled some of the resupplying of the warspite from their recent mission
<br>
<br>Come on now, place the extra photon torps down in room 4 section E, you know if you placed them in the B section they could easily blow from the heat of the turbo lasers. You don't wanna be coming home in a vase do you? Neither do I.....
<br>
<br>just shaking his head as he talked to a few other officers from some of the various ported ships, he'd rather gain personal intelligence about what was happening in the areas around than trust listening to the republican intelligence agency. Moving back to his ship as he surveyed some of the exterior things, checking some of the hull, though nodding lightly, the warspite was starting to get rough looking, possibly needing a new paint job..pondering about putting that in the next time he's at port
<br>
<br>Come on now loaders, we've gotta get on out of here and head to our next destination.

Michael was thinking on the last time he attacked Horus while his shuttle was starting into the atmosphere of Delasol.
<br>
<br>A fleet of dozens of Star Destroyers led by the Eclipse Class Super Star Destroyer Dominant, followed by a great disaster. Not shields nor armor of the gigantic warship were able to turn their fate, not even the mounted super laser. Sure Horus suffered some losses as well in this battle, but it was more the rebellion within the own ranks of the Imperial 5th fleet that brought that war to an end.
<br>
<br>Well, the same opponent, just this time they were fighting for the Republic. And Michael was sure, this time fate would be on their side.
<br>
<br>In this moment the shuttle started the landing process on the Prometheus.

Matt sat at the desk in his quarters aboard the CRS Payback, comparing various datapads on the historical and current activities of galactic pirates. There had not been many encounters with pirates in the Alpharing System, but it was Battlegroup Hunter's assignment to smoke any out.
<br>
<br>After some time studying piracy, Matt grabbed his comlink, "Wolverine, I'm on my way to the bridge. Could you please meet up with me there at your convenience?"
<br>
<br>Matt stood up, gave a yawn and an exaggerated stretch, and then headed to the bridge with a quick stride. He thought, Pirates are only going to run from a ship like the Payback. What we need is a decoy to lure the pirates into an ambush.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">High Admiral Matt Sifi</p>

Mike was in his quarter reading the some reports from their last potral in the Alpharing System.When his comlink beeped and he pick it up.
<br>"Commander Skywaler here."
<br>"Commander you have temporary assignment on the CRS Payback and report to High Admiral Matt."
<br>I wonder if the other members of Auric Squadron have the same assignment as I Mike thought after he received that message from the wing commander.
<br>"Copy that,over and out."
<br>Mike got up from his table and put on his pilot uniform.Then head to the hanger bay to board his fighter for the long ride to the Payback.
<br>
<br>Coming out of hyperspace from a short system jump
<br>
<br>It been hour after he left the Predator to report High Admiral Matt.Mike looked down at the timer to see how long till he comes out of hyperspace.Before he looked back up the stars where returning back to normal.man look at that ship Mike thought when he came out of hyperspace.
<br>"Commader Skywaler to the CRS Payback, permission to land."

Raul had finished checking the fleet messages left for him, and he shook his head. Another daring attack mission. This one should end better, or so he hoped. It had been a while since he had had some space combat. Making sure everything was where it should be...his ship, his lightsaber, his blaster pistol...he made his way back to the Lambda class shuttle he had taken, and began the preflight checks. Everything checked out, and he began to make his way through the the sky, gaining clearance from the tower as he did so. Into space he went, then with a flick of his wrist...into hyperspace. He had a few hours yet, so he left the ship on auto-pilot, and rose from his chair. He made his way to the docking area of the shuttle, and unclipped his lightsaber. As he did so, the training droid flickered to life, and he ignited his saber. As he did so, the droid began spattering bolts of red energy towards him. They were set for full effect, so he knew that any missed would be quite painful. Throughout the flight back to the Warspite, he worked on his trainings, reflecting countless bolts...and getting stung more than a few times...but all in all, a good workout with minimal pain involved.
<br>
<br>Soon, the signal from the bridge told him that he was nearing his destination, so as he ended his training, panting and having worked up a sweat, he used the Force to grab a hold of the training droid, and keep it in place as he flicked off it's power switch. He then flipped his lightsaber off as well, and clipped it back to his belt, walking towards the bridge area. When the hyperdrive beeped again, he shut it off, and came back into real space...about 1000 kilometers from the bow of the Warspite. He hailed them...
<br>
<br>"Commodore Jaknae, piloting the shuttle War Party, requesting permission to come aboard."
<br>
<br>The ensign on the comm recognized the markings, and the signature checked out, so he responded...
<br>
<br>Ensign: "Granted War Party, and welcome back."
<br>
<br>Raul began to make his way towards the hangar bay of the ship, piloting the shuttle with the practiced ease of someone who had grown up flying such things. He had began to get far more familiar with starfighter craft as of late, and he was a gutsy pilot...taking many chances he would tell others not to even attempt. Life on the fringed, before his time in the Fleet, had given him that gambler's instinct...to know when your hand was good enough to win...to know when to bluff....and to know when the hell to get out of there. The wings folded up over his shuttle as he touched down, and began towards the ramp...almost glad to be back on the Warspite, after his time on Yavin IV and then Coruscant.

Ash stood by his fighter aboard the Payback applying the final stage of repairs that he considered highly important, painting the signature DarkStar black stripes. Upon completion he stepped back and nodded in approval, which from Bolts' beeping he assumed the droid agreed. Turning round Ash saw a ship coast into the hangar and recognized it as from the Predator, he ambled over to meet whoever exited. Ash had been cleared for duty since fighting the Sith on Korriban but he was still covered with wounds which would take time to heal without Bacta, he'd also lost his right eye from the Sith so concealed it's tattered remains with a patch. Commander Skywaler climbed out and they saluted each other,
<br>
<br>"Good to see you Mike, So what brings you to the Payback?"
<br>
<br>"I'll tell you over a drink. Which way to the bar on this tub?"
<br>
<br>"Follow me, officer's mess is on D Deck."
<br>
<br>They walked off to the turbolift deep in conversation.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Ash Halcyon</p>
<p class="text">	
Michael was checking a list of stored supplies on the datapad.
<br>
<br>"5000 torpedoes less then requested."
<br>
<br>The Fallen general on the left side of Michael started replying: "Well, the maximum we could get. Other Republican fleets are fighting as well. If we have one week more time we can surely organize the rest of the torpedoes."
<br>
<br>"Too many people already know about the campaign. It's just a matter of time till Horus finds out abut our plans. And I would prefer to take out Horus's first planets before he finds out."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
As Mike and Thes head off to the officer mass on D deck.Mike was thinking about his last mission on Korrain and he needs to report to his master at HQ.
<br>In the Office mass.
<br>
<br>Drinking a few havy drinks which didn't make him drunk yet.But he went on and answer Ash question after he landed in the hanger bay of the Payback.
<br>
<br>"Well my friend I'm here for temroray orders and fight along with the pilots of Payback.Hows you wounds from the battle on Korrian.''
<br>
<br>Taking another drink from his beer in his hand.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commander Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Ash pointed at his face,
<br>
<br>"Meh, it's not as bad as it looks besides you should see the other guy"
<br>
<br>It still made Ash shudder to think of the hateful Sith consumed in flame but at the same time he drew satisfaction fro a job well done. Leaning over he gestured to the bartender for more drinks and lowering his tone of voice leaned towards Mike.
<br>
<br>"Between you and me pilots, troops and supplies have been coming in all day, no official paperwork or anything. You know what that means an ops coming up and a big one at that"
<br>
<br>Mike nodded solemnly staring into his empty glass, "Must be Horus"
<br>
<br>Just then a waitress wandered over with their drinks and the conversation's tone lightened, Ash drank deep from his Ebla beer and hoped like hell it wouldn't be one of his last.

Wolverine walked through the Level D Mess Hall, past Ash and Skywaler when he got the call to meet up with the ship Commander. "In route." His cloak drifted behind him almost as though he were a ghost, he wasted no time as he entered the bridge.
<br>
<br>"Admiral, you needed something?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Wolverine</p>
<p class="text">
"Yes, Wolverine, thank you for meeting me," Matt greeted him. He turned to gaze at the stars, "I've been putting off a medical issue that can wait no longer to be dealt with. In a matter of hours, I will be taking a shuttle to Coruscant for a minor operation. If all goes as planned I will be back on the Payback as fast as my hyperdrives can carry me."
<br>
<br>Matt blinked and turned back to face Wolverine, his face hardening a bit, "Anyway, there are more relevant issues to be discussed. We aren't having much luck uprooting pirates out here. I've thought of a plan in which we could use a decoy ship in pseudo-distress to lure in any pirates, while the Payback and other support vessels lie in wait for an ambush. I realize this plan is a bit ethically sketchy, so we must attempt to disable and capture the pirates rather than destroy them."
<br>
<br>The firmness left Matt's face entirely, "Wolverine, my old friend, I would like you to take command of the Payback and execute the pirate-capture plan in my stead. I have every confidence in your abilities. Besides," Matt grinned, "I'll only be gone for a few days."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Fleet Admiral Matt Sifi</p>
<p class="text">
Wolverine nodded, "It shall be done." He left the room and went to his quarters to start drafting plans for the days ahead. He would need to keep this low key should there be any pirate-sympathizers on board the Payback.
<br>
<br>He would need to call in DarkStar Squadron from the boundaries of Chiss Space for this, but until they arrived, he would have to make due with the current personal on board. He clicked his comlink, "Wolverine to Halcyon, Skywaler, Johnson and Peters. Report to my quarters immediately."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Wolverine</p>
<p class="text">
The Rear Admiral was sitting in his office, he had just finished the paperwork for his members who were sent to the other ships to reinforce them before the attack against Warlord Horus.
<br>The pain of seeing the rest of the fleet form up and preparing for battle while the Predator did not, scarred Mattias deeply. But this was beyond him, there were times when he would sign-up directly not thinking of the consequences.
<br>
<br>But those times were long gong, they had disappeared with Mattias' age and experience, a band of vicious raiders using a Marauder and almost a whole Y-Wing Squadron seemed to be attacking both civilian and military convoys at random and they seemed to be operating around the Predator's designated area of patrol.
<br>
<br>If it hadn't been for these pirates, Mattias feared that his combat skills would deteriorate and he still took some pride in that he would be defending the other ships' supply-line, he knew that without proper replacement fighters, missiles, torpedoes, hull material and energy-sources. It was gonna be a battle that would echo across the galaxy, who would be left to defend Delasol?
<br>Sure the Angel of Death was still around but a ship that size didn't serve as a ship-to-ship hunter and was easily out maneuvered.
<br>
<br>Rear Admiral Gustafsson pressed the "Confirm" button and saw the pilot's temporary position being sent to the main database.
<br>I hope they'll be alright, or else that Horus is gonna have to answer to me he thought as he saw the orders before him on the screen. He pressed the datapad and began writing another message, destination Prometheus
<br>To: Grand Admiral Michael Simon
<br>From: Rear Admiral Mattias Gustafsson.
<br>
<br>Admiral, the Predator has sent it's pilots to the Payback, we are soon beginning our preparations to find these Pirates, I assure you, your supplies will not be delayed, you have my word.
<br>
<br>Once again Rear Admiral Gustafsson sent a message that he didn't want to, he would rather have it saying that the Predator will be right beside the Prometheus until the end.
<br>Mattias missed the old Fighter Pilot days... a lot...

Mike was done with his drink when his comlink beeped, "Wolverine to Halcyon, Skywaler, Johnson and Peters. Report to my quarters immediately."
<br>
<br>"I'm on my way, sir." Mike turned his comlink off and turned to face Ash. "Lets go Ash, Wolverine needs us."
<br>
<br>Mike thank the bartender for the drinks.They left the officer mass and headed to Wolverines quarters.
<br>
<br>whispering to Ash."Hey Ash,Do you know why Commodore Wolverine what us for."

The Prometheus jumped out of hyperspace close to the Republican space station in the orbit of Alpharing III.
<br>
<br>Grand Admial Andries was checking the radar signatures on the display, but just Republican IDs were visible.
<br>
<br>Maybe one, maybe two minutes later the radar display started to glow more and more. Dozends of new Republican ID codes popped up. The freighters had jumped into the system, also the other ships of Battlegroup One together with some TIE Avengers from the Prometheus.
<br>
<br>
<br>Michael was sitting in his office. Different to the other officers on the ship that were expecting a pirate attack, which was pretty unrealistic cause the handfull of outdated fighters shouldn't be a real thread for a Republican fleet of modern warships. The real thread for the fleet would come when the fleet enters the dominion of warlord Horus.
<br>

<br>He just noticed an imcomming mail from Rear Admiral Gustafsson. Excellent, the plan was getting contures.
<br>
<br>10 hours left till the big holo meeting, 24 hours till the breakup into Horus territories.

Thes landed in the hanger bay of the Payback and climbed out of his A-wing, stretching after his flight. 'Well, i guess I better find Wolverine and report in.' He thought, as he left the hanger and headed towards the command quarters.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text"> 
Wolverine sat in his quarters as Halcyon, Skywaler, Johnson, Peters and Thes entered. He wasn't expecting to see Thes, but he could always use his Padawan to help the mission ahead.
<br>
<br>"High Admiral Sifi is taking a brief leave of absence to the core for operation. I will be the Commanding Officer onboard until he returns, what is discussed here stays here. I better not hear otherwise out there." He shuffled through his paperwork. "The mission we are to attempt in the High Admiral's absence is once of precision. We must lure a group of nearby pirates to us in a distress call and capture as many as possible for interrogation on the Warlord Horus and his territories."
<br>
<br>"DarkStar Squadron is currently in route back from Chiss Space, so they'll be a few days from return. Therefore, I will be assigning Skywaler, Johnson and Peters as the decoy distress ship in a old snub-cargo vessel we've salvaged; while Thes and Halcyon will be the capturing party, their X-Wings will be modified for the task of stunning the enemies ship systems so they deactivate. So take your shots carefully you two."
<br>
<br>Wolverine sat back in his chair, "any questions?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Wolverine</p>
<p class="text"> 
"yes,if the pirates attack the old snub-cargo vessel.After we send out a fake distress call.Does this old snub-cargo vessel have any weapons we can use, before Ash and Thes come from there short jump help us capture the pirates ships."

<br>Mike wanted for Wolverine asnwer while he look at the crew he was going to command.

Michael was looking out of the window on the bridge of the ASD Prometheus, the fleet was slowly assambling. 9 hours left, till the holomeeting.
<br>
<br>"Admiral Simon, Commodore Jockels waits for you in the meeting room C21." One of the communication officers said to Michael.
<br>
<br>"Will be there in a minute." Michael replied.
<br>
<br>Ok usually it would take a bit more time to get from the bridge of the Prometheus into the center backboard section, but well.
<br>
<br>Few minutes later Michael had reached the meeting room. An Rear Admiral from the military intelligence and a Commodore from the tactical division were already there.
<br>
<br>"Admiral." Both officers saluted.
<br>
<br>Michael returned the salute: "Gentlemen, you have recalculated the stats?"
<br>
<br>"Well additionally to the percentage the capitol ships have to reduce speed to have the same speed in hyperspace as their escort ships, we have calculated the numbers to get the entire fleet in at once. This was a bit a problem. Sure the different length and the gravitational disturbances are known, but it's a pretty long jump and the engines usually don't have such a stable output that the speed wouldn't varie about a few tenth of a promille. Expecially the older stardestroyers have problems there." The commodore explained.
<br>
<br>"I see," Michael replied "Well we have to take it as it is. So how much do the Carreir Groups have to reduce their speed?"
<br>
<br>"Well, Carrier Group Payback has the longest way from Alpharing, so they don't need to reduce their speed. Carrier Group Warspite need to reduce their speed by 1.7 percent to arrice at their target at the same time plus minus a few minutes. Battlegroup One and Carrier Groups Angel of Death and Predator from Battlegroup Hunter need to reduce speed by 1.8 to 1.9 percent to reach their target and Carrier Group Zentar need to reduce spped by 2.1 percent for their first target."
<br>
<br>"The freigthers will arrive about half an hour later then. I have thought on giviing them the CG Hamburg as escort. Can you calculate the reduced speed for the Hamburg nes then?"
<br>
<br>"Well, I could do sir, but I guess it's easier if the navgation officer of the Hamburg directly contacts the freighters to adjust their speed."
<br>
<br>"Ok, thanks Commodore." Michael turned to the Rear Admiral "Admiral van Kloum, any updates on our targets so far?"
<br>
<br>"Sorry, no sir, difficult getting anything out of the area at the moment ..."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
"It's a cargo ship, so no weapons are on it. The shields are going to appear to be damaged as well as the outer hull, we will have a backup generator installed should things go wrong."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Wolverine</p>
<p class="text"> 
"Sounds like fun master," Thes said, "however, what if they send a force out larger than expected, do we still have to disable or can we eliminate if necessary to protect the freighter?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
"If a force is greater than anticipated, notify me and the Payback will come in to aid. We must capture as many as possible though, thats the objective. Get some rest, the task starts in 12 hours."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Wolverine</p>
<p class="text">  	 	
A bit more then 8 hours were remaining till the holo meeting, 22 hours till the start of the mission. Michael was talking to one of the communication officers on the bridge of the ASD Prometheus.
<br>
<br>"Ready to test the communications with those parts of the fleet that haven't already assambled at Alpharing?"
<br>
<br>"Testing the channels already. Having someinteferrecnes on the communication frequeces for the ships of Battlegroup Hunter. May take some minutes to get this working."
<br>
<br>"Till in a few minutes then." Michael replied before he went of checking the status of the fighter squadrons on the Prometheus.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
"Yes,sir."
<br>After the briefing was over Mike went to the quarters that was sign to him.When he came onboard the Payback from the Perdator.In his quarters Mike was going over the blueprint of the vessel he will be in during this operation.Well Wolverine is right about the vessel,there isn't any weapon on this junk of bolts Mike thought after putting down the data pad.

Ash saluted and turned to leave Wolverine's office but in mid turn stopped,
<br>
<br>"Sir, I just wanted to say how sorry I'm for your loss"
<br>
<br>"Noted Halcyon"
<br>
<br>With that Ash left but couldn't help himself being shaken, Wolverine's face had been emotionless but his anger was almost palpable and his eyes brought back memories of a dead man's eyes, dark and dead.

<p class="text">
Thes left Wolverines office and headed for the cantina. 'Well 12 hours to kill, might as well get some food and relax a while.' As he walked the corridors, he couldnt help get the feeling that somewhere in this mission, he would learn a horrible secret.

<p class="text">
"It's a wonder why Awna ever agreed to marry you to begin with." She muttered.
<br>
<br>Wolverine stopped. "What's that supposed to mean?"
<br>
<br>"Nothing." She paused. "It's just that you are always running off on your little adventures instead of spending time with her."
<br>
<br>"She's off on her own adventure Aniya, and I don't want her or our daughter in danger."
<br>
<br>"Always think you'll be there to protect her Wolverine?" She shook her head. "As much as you want to, the only one who can protect her is her. You need to accept that and let her be her own person."
<br>
<br>Wolverine shook the memories from his head as he continued to get the paperwork filed away. Whatever happened to Talon wasn't the issue, it was that he let Aniya die and he couldn't protect her. Just like she'd said about his wife, Awna. He remembered looking into Awna's eyes to tell her the news about her sister.
<br>
<br>"Wolverine, you're alright!" She flung herself into his arms, she bounced back quickly, forgetting she was pregnant. "I heard about Talon, it's nothing you could've done."
<br>
<br>"I know." He let himself rest on the sofa. "It's just-."
<br>
<br>Awna looked around outside. "Where's Aniya at?"
<br>
<br>He gulped, the guilt had been driving him mad his trip back to Nal Hutta to see his wife. "She."
<br>
<br>Awna didn't need him to finish the sentence, her body froze. "Oh no!" She bent down, using the sofa for support and started crying. "No, no no!"
<br>
<br>Wolverine held back his own tears and went to hold his wife. "It's my fault, I couldn't protect her. I'm sorry." A tear came down his face.
<br>
<br>Awna kept on crying herself to sleep.
<br>
<br>Paperwork, it wasn't something Wolverine cheerished. It wasn't something that was going to get done with his constant reminders of the past, but it was something that would keep him sharp for the times ahead. He couldn't fail anyone anymore, not like he had Aniya.
<br>
<br>He signed the paperwork and filed it away.

6 hours remaining till the meeting. Somehow Michael started to get nervous; pretty unusual for him. Michael had been in many large battles and campaigns in the last years. All of them were risky and the success quote was maybe 60 percent.
<br>
<br>Michael left his office and went along the corridor to the next turbo list. Maybe on the bridge there would be some activity.
<br>
<br>20 hours remaining till start of the mission.

In his quarters Mike was getting ready for mission that was going to capture some pirates.So they can get some answers from them about a Warlords Horus' plans.Before he went to the hanger bay Mike sent a holomessage to his master.
<br>
<br>"Hello master,I'm sorry I took to long at Korrian.I ran into some trouble on Korrian.But I like to talk to you about what happen at Korrian after this operation.I'll see again master and may the force be with you."
<br>
<br>Mike ended the holo message and sent the message to his master.Then Mike left his quarters to head to the cantina.To get something to eat before he headed to the hanger bay.While he was walking to the cantia to get something to eat Mike unclipped his comlink from his belt to contact Wolverine.
<br>
<br>"Comander Skywaler to Commordore Wolverine.What the name of the vessel was I don't remeber the name of the vessel.Because you just called it a snub-cargo vessel." Mike said in the comlink tring to be funny about the question.

"Old Glory is its name."

High Admiral Horn's shuttle had arrived in one of the hangars of the ASD Prometheus. Michael together with a staff of officers from the Prometheus were welcomming him in the hangar.
<br>
<br>"Hello Corran, meeting should start soon." Michael mentioned.
<br>
<br>"The plan is still the same?"
<br>
<br>"Well, basically, ..."
<br>
<br>Less then 2 hours remaning till the meeting.

managed to return back to the bridge as the Warspite sat course for the meeting, yes of course she was late, as usual. Gene looking around for a moment before speaking over the loudspeaker
<br>
<br>I want a full system's check of everything to be run. Everything checked out and to be confirmed it's ready for it's max. I want all essential crew to rest, including pilots and turret gunners. After I return from the meeting, I want everyone gathered for a mass ship briefing on what is going on. Ice out.
<br>
<br>switching it off as he continued to watch as stars blazed by, pondering on what will happen...though...having a grave feeling his ship might not make it...at that moment his comm officer piping up
<br>
<br>Sir, the ASD Promethesus are doing tests right now, shall I send back we read them loud and clear?
<br>
<br>Yes yes, send a message along that next time I want sandpeople moving stuff around my ship than my own men....

A couple of higher officers were sitting around an oval table in one of the conference rooms of the Prometheus. Basically everyone in higher ranks and positions in the fleet was present there, or at least via hologramm at the meeting. Around the table and the seats at it was some space before additional rows of seats had been with more officers whaiting on the meeting. Michael was standing up and started to speak to the assabeled commanders.
<br>
<br>"Well I guess most officers in here know that we are going once more into battle with the Remnant Imperial warlord and former Imperial Grand Admiral Victor Sunmin, better known as Horus. The Republican navy is still involved in several battles against warlord Horus and many of you may remember us fighting against him not too long ago.
<br>The 5th fleet is in position here at Alpharing to make an assault on Horus' backyard. Horus made arrangements with the nearby remnant leaders in the region, maybe to have more troops available for the assault on the republican forces on the other side, maybe to prepare a major assault against the Remnants and keeping them unprepared.
<br>But this time we will do the first strike. Ogompak is a central nexus in warlord Horus' support routes. After conquering Fnarit Klirr Horus has moved his fleet, consisting of an Stardestroyer Imperium Class another Stardestroyer Victory Class as well as a couple of smaller escort ships, from Ogompak to that position, as well as most of the infantry divisions.
<br>Well, we will be deep within enemy territories, surrounded by all kind of remnant fractions, sure we will temporary take Ogompak as base of opperations, but will will try to stay mobile as possible, and we have to keep an eye on our resources cause they will be pretty limited this time.
<br>Well Admiral Horn will start with the campaign details."
<br>
<br>High Admiral Horn was steppung up while Michael was sitting down.
<br>
<br>"Battlegroup Zentar together with the Carrier Group Payback will take out the connection to the other parts of Warlord Horus dominion. Carrier group Zentar will start with taking out the relais stations at Zartessol and Ante Delim. Unfortunatly Horus seems to take his Relais posts more important then others, so the relais isn't on a simple sattelite but inside a platform guarded by 2 squadrons of TIE Fighters.
<br>Carrier Group Zentar will leave hyperspace at Zartessol. Drop two squadron of B-Wings and 2 squadrons of X-Wings. These 4 wings will jump to the Ante Delim Relais Station and take it out. Meanwhile the rest of the Carrier Group will take out the Relais Station at Zartessol.
<br>Carrier Group Warpite will attack the convoi route at Anguna. Before reaching the fuel station at Anguna convois have to drop out of hyperspace to pass an asteroid belt around the planet the fuel station is orbiting. Fighters from the station usually keep a corridor through the asteroid belt clear from asteroids.
<br>The Warspite should arrive in the system at the same time as a freighter covoi of 20 freighters and has to take the convoi out while it's passing the corridor through the asteroid belt. The convoi is escorted by 2 Nebulon-B Frigates and 2 Corellian Corvettes. There are additional TIE Fighters from the station in the corridor, protecting the corridor from enemies and ateroids.
<br>Commodore Gene Starwind has to take out the convoi before it passes the corridor. The fuel station itself is refunctioned smaller star fortress and shouldn't be attacked.
<br>Carrier Group Payback will take out the fuel station at Featippa. It's a simple station, just defended by a few outdated turbo lasers and a TIE Fighter squadron.
<br>Around ten minutes later a convoi will arrive there, same size as the convoi in Anguna, 20 freighters, two frigates, two corvettes. This convoi need to be taken out too.
<br>3 stations, 24 squadrons and 48 ships are a lot work for us to do in the first part of this campaign, well good hunting.
<br>When the missions are accomplished we return to Ogompak."
<br>
<br>High Admiral Horn was sitting down again and Michael was continuing.
<br>
<br>"Well let's continue with Battlegroup Hunter, Admiral Angelus."
<br>
<br>High Admiral Angelus was standing up:
<br>
<br>"The Rest of Battlegroup Hunter, Carrier Groups Angel of Death and Predator will start the attack against Ogompak III. We will attack the planet from the backside, attacking the two armored space platforms there and maybe taking out some of the ships defending the planet.
<br>Horus has two frigates and a few smaller corvettes in the defense of the planet."
<br>
<br>"Finally Battlegroup One."
<br>
<br>Grand Admiral Andries was continuing:
<br>
<br>"Well, we will attack Ogompak III from the other side. There is a platform that needs to be taken out and there are maybe some smaller ships in the orbit or fighters from bases on the planet.
<br>Fortunatly Horus doesn't have front troops on Ogompak III. TIE Fighters, maybe even older versions, maybe a few Bombers and Interceptors. We will start landing ground forces on the planet then. Horus has only 3 light infantry divisions on the planet under the command of Field Marshal Garris, but they have fortified their positions.
<br>The convoi will arrive half an hour later then, cause of the slower hyperdrives of the freighters. We should have control over the area of their arrival till then. The remaining ground forces will be landed on the planet then. Together we have 6 divisions on the planet then, and with the air support of our fighter bomber squadrons we should be able to hold down the opponent troops long enough."
<br>
<br>Grand Admiral Andries was sitting down and it was Michael's turn again.
<br>
<br>"Well, and now to the main plan. Horus has two Superstardestroyers with the cloaking device of the Terror in the region. I hope we make enough trouble for Horus that he sends them after us, and then we will take them out.
<br>Without them Horus will loose control over the region. Horus has reposition his fleet then to regain stability. That will be the point, where Horus will be really vulnerable.
<br>The task is very difficult, so we may loose as well, but it's a pretty unique chance to hit Horus where it really hurts him."

Mike was doing some scans on the extra shield generator on Old Glory to see if it was in working order.As the hanger crew was bussing around the ship geting it ready for the mission to gather some information from some pirates in this area.After long hours of doing systems checks and making shore every thing was running. Mike got off the of the cargo vessel to look at the fake hull that was going to make this mission inpossible.Then he unclipped his comlink to contact Wolverine before he went back on board Old Glory.
<br>
<br>"Commader Skywaler to Commodero Wolverine. Old Glory is ready for the mission.Before we depart is there any orders from HQ before we capture any pirates and bring them in for questioning."

Rear Admiral Gustafsson was sitting in his holoseat onboard the Predator, they had just dropped out from hyperspace and was moving into escort position of the Angel of Death, even though the Promatheus wasn't far away, Mattias had decided to participate through hologram.
<br>
<br>He listened carefully to the plan, Zentar's attacks didn't seem so hard at Stage One, even the surprising 2 TIE Fighter Squadrons guarding the relay-stations wasn't much to worry about for 2 Squadrons of X-Wings and 2 Squadrons of B-Wings.
<br>Tax was more interested in Warspite's mission, that one was much more difficult. Battles against proven anti-fighter ships like the Nebulon-B and Corellian Corvettes in and around an asteroid-field is nothing that should be taken lightly. Tax feared for his pilots.
<br>
<br>He wasn't quite as worried about his pilots onboard the Payback, they would have time to strike the fuel station, rearm and regroup before engaging the convoy.
<br>Provided there would be little or no surprises, Tax was confident that the attacks would go well.
<br>
<br>Now was showtime, Admiral Angelus stood up and explained what the Angel and Predator would do, didn't sound like anything complicated really, attacking two armoured platforms with an SSD was nothing, the Predator was surely there to sweep up anything that would be left.
<br>When Gustafsson heard that BG One would be attacking from the other side there wasn't much left to worry about. Fighters and bombers would be the only real problem but the SSD and Promatheus packed enough squadrons to counter anything.
<br>
<br>Tax switched off his audiogram and spoke to one of his officers.
<br>"Make sure our Marauder is ready, we're gonna need it's laser batteries. Oh, and alert our commandos, have them on stand-by.
<br>
<br>Tax switched back his audiogram and spoke when an opportunity presented itself.
<br>"Rear Admiral Gustafsson here, what will we do if some of the smaller carrier-groups encounter heavy resistance? Is there some kind of reinforcement available will that only be squadrons from one of the other carriers or is there some kind of heavier support standing-by?

Wolverine listened to Skywaler's request. "Affirmative, get Peters and yourself in the vessel, we are almost at our destination."
<br>
<br>Wolverine ordered the pilots to pull the ship out of hyperspace near an asteroid cluster. They were approximately 6 days out from Featippa fuel station, Darkstar Squadron was a few systems out and would meet them in 3 days half way there.
<br>
<br>"Commodore Wolverine to Crew Members: Thes and Halcyon. Report to the hangar bay for your run." He turned back to his crew on the bridge who were looking at him curiously, most likely wondering what he meant by 'run.' To keep things on the low, he opened the channel once more. "Commodore Wolverine to all pilot cadets, go to the sim room for flight practice." He looked back at his crew and they went back to work like it was nothing afterall. Just like he needed them to think.
<br>
<br>Wolverine walked from the bridge, for once in his fleet uniform. His lightsaber was still clipped to his side, other than that, he could pass off for a real officer. He turned down the hall and made his way to the sim room, the door slid open and he entered.
<br>
<br>The chatter in the room went zero the moment he entered. The cadets all looked around.
<br>
<br>"At ease cadets, who's incharge of your training today?" Wolverine asked.
<br>
<br>One of the cadets laughed, "instructors sick sir. That's why we were all talking before you entered." He was kicked quickly by another cadet to be quiet.
<br>
<br>Wolverine nodded. "Good work cadet, I need you to lead the class in their sims today then. I want a full report from you on what you covered, as well as each cadets knowledge of their ships in-and-outs." He turned to the other cadets, "you all need to submit a report following his, the topic will be an evaluation of your temporary instructor. Leave emotion out of it please, just the facts." He saw the cadet he appointed instructor drop his jaw at the order and turned to leave the room. He wouldn't tolerate anything less than a satisfactory report, even if it was going to be thrown away the moment they left his office.

<br>Mike turned off his comlink walked right up the boarding ramp.At the same time he was ordering Peters to get on board along with other crew members for this mission.
<br>"Peters, get on board and get ready for lift off.Payback is a few mintues from its destination."
<br>"I'm coming commander." Peters answered from the other side of Old Glory. On the command bridge of Old Glory Mike push the com channel buttion so he can contact Commodero Wolverine to tell him everyone was ready on Old Glory.
<br>"Commodore everything is in place. How long till Payback come out of hyperspace."
<br>As Mike was saying this Thes and Halcyon just made it to their fighters for this mission.Mike waited for his answer and at the same time he contact Thes and Halcyon on his comlink.
<br>"Thes and Ash see y'all in a short while and may the force be with you."
<br>Mike check everything before he got any answer from Wolverine. I hope the group of pirates we are going to capture won't fight back Mike thought while he was seating in the pilots seat.Mike looked over and Peters final got on the vessel.Which he didn't mind because He was waiting for the signal from Wolverine and Payback to come out of hyperspace.

Raul had gotten his flying orders from the Fleet while he had been getting prepaired in his quarters. he wasn;t exactly sure, though, which he should be leading...the flight group of fighters, or staying with the Warspite against the freighters and frigates. Both would be challenging missions, to be sure...and his E-wing would be of valuable assistance in either place. Of course...being a Commodore now, he also might be pushed into commanding a frigate or another larger ship and kept from the battle itself...which didn't sit too well with him. However, he also knew that they tended not to let their senior officiers get into dogfights often...and while he loved a good space battle...he had to bow to their wishes. Jedi Knights would be valuable leaders, both in space and on the bridges of ships. He would seek out his former Master, Commodore Starwind, to get his final assignments. Flight suit on, just in case, as well as a lightsaber clipped to his belt...he was ready for whatever the case may be.

watched from his seat there in the Helm as the Grand Admiral gave the battle plan, all was quiet as they allowed Gene to watch and ponder. Viewing the map that was rose up...he'd ponder...before waiting towards the end to question the Grand Admiral
<br>
<br>Grand Admiral Simon, Do you wish for the ships carrying good and such to be completely destroyed or captured, and, do we have any intelligence on what they may be carrying?
<br>
<br>writing down some stuff on his holopad as he made somewhat of a creud sketch and pondered, he'd rather get there just a minute or 2 right before that convoy jumped hyperspace, wanting to position the Warspite just infront of that asteroid path, his escort ships in the rear to pincer the group, though, he'd be taking the brute of all fire

Mike was thinking up a plan to capture the pirates .When Peters walked over to the copilot seat and sat down next to his seat.Peters didn't say anything to him and went right to work checking the scan reports Mike did a hour ago on the second shield genertor.Mike just let him be and went back to his planing for the pirates if they come on board the Old Glory.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commander Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text"> 
Didn't take long to reply Commodore Starwinds request:
<br>
<br>"Well, not at the current phase. The first phase of the opperation should be very quick. Scanning cargo, disableing specified freighters, boarding them with a boarding team and bring them into savety just takes to long. At a later part of the campaign we maybe need to capture some freighters, but currently we have enough resources."
<br>
<br>A bit later on the bridge of the Prometheus. The Prometheus was already preparing for the jump into hyperspace. One of the communications officers was talking to Michael.
<br>
<br>"Admiral, we got a coded transmission from the navy command."
<br>
<br>Michael was checking the terminal the message got displayed. Maybe something important, ... promotions. Maybe hundret names on the list, maybe ten of them officers. Lieutenant Commander Ash Halcyon, Lieutenant Commander Quejo Bandon, Lieutenant Commander Thes Nazud, Second Lieutenant Vladek Solander, ... Well the high command could have sent to promotions a bit earlier, maybe just one day earlier.
<br>
<br>"What should I do with the transmission, Admiral?"
<br>
<br>"Send transmissions to the ships of the officers and crewmen that got promoted."
<br>
<br>
<br>Some time later; Michael was still on the bridge and the fleet had moved into formation. Small flashes appeared in the window when the firs ships of the fleet went into hyperspace. Within a moment all ships in front of the Prometheus had went into hyperspace and with a bit of shaking on the brige the ASD followed the others into hyperspace.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Angel of Death, the Predator, the Prometheus and the Immortal had meanwhile left hyperspace again. The battleships we're preparing to attack the planetary platforms from two sides, with medium speed they were moving to their targets to give several hundrets of fighters the chance to launch from the hangar bays.
<br>
<br>Somehow the cordination with the Zentar hadn't worked that well. Maybe influenced through an unknown gravity field the Carrier Group had reach it's target tem minutes ealier then the rest of the fleet. The Zentar had already send squadront two it's second target and had started the attack on the platform.

<br><br><b>Assault on Featippa</b></p>

<p class="text">
When Carrier Group Payback had reached the refuel station in the Featippa system the convoy had already started refueling. Ten freighters were done with the process, 3 were docked at the platform Zevas Halati IX, seven more waiting for a free docking position to refuel as well.
<br>
<br>Frigate Zadolt Ferra, Frigate Jubelt I and Corvette Bogenschmidt were defending the station. The frigates and the platform were starting the TIE Fighter Squadron Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Mu and Nu.

Mike was on the Old Glory when he saw a message he missed.
<br>"Commander Skywaler scrap the mission you are in You are Squadron commander of Green squadron on the Payback and Tarform Boggs is your Vice Squadron Commander during the assault on the refuel station ..Fleet Headquarters out."
<br>After he read the message he got on his com link to contact Wolverine.
<br>"Commodore,this is Commander Skywaler please come in.I just orders from HQ saying I'm Green Squadron Commander and Tarform Boggs is my Vice Squadron Commander on the Payback.Looks like we have to scrap this mission for now Commodore and what does Green Squadron fly,sir."
<br>Mike turn around and headed out of the bridge of Old glory.While he was doing this he was wanting on Wolverines answer.Then out of no wear Tie fighters starting attacking Old Glory.
<br>"Peters get the other shield genertor on line now."
<br>"yes.sir"

Matt's shuttle dropped out of hyperspace a ways behind the Payback, returning from Coruscant. His medical operation had gone well, and he spent some time healing before returning to active duty.
<br>
<br>"CRS Payback, this is High Admiral Sifi requesting dockage." Matt keyed in his security code and waited a moment before receiving an affirmative from the bridge, "Proceeding to docking bay."
<br>
<br>Matt switched frequencies on his commlink, "Commodore Wolverine, have I missed anything interesting? I'll be on board in a few moments."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">High Admiral Matt Sifi</p>
<p class="text"> 
"You heard command, seems the High Admiral had a change of heart. Get back to the Payback for your assigned squadron Skywaler."
<br>
<br>Wolverine turned to the bridge crew. "Raise shields and full power to foreword batteries." He turned as they transmitted the orders to his comlink. "This is Commodore Wolverine of the CRS Payback, go ahead."
<br>
<br>"So formal," Wolverine recognized the voice instantly. "Figured we'd lend you a hand out here."
<br>
<br>Wolverine smiled. "I take it the rest are with you?"
<br>
<br>"Indeed, they just returned from Chiss Space." Awna informed him.
<br>
<br>"Good." He sat down in the command chair. "Lieutenant, bring the ship parallel to the Corvette Bogenschmidt. With any luck, we can take out the two flights of fighters defending the station in the process."
<br>
<br>The Lieutenant nodded and instructed the pilot and crew operating the battery turrets of the order.
<br>
<br>"Where do you need us?" Awna asked over the comlink.
<br>
<br>Wolverine looked around and saw the Old Glory cargo vessel on its way back to the Payback. The Alpha Tie Fighter group was in route to make short work of Skywaler, Peters, and Johnson. "Take DarkStar Squadron and escort the cargo vessel back to the ship. Its essential that they don't die."
<br>
<br>"Roger."
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Tie Fighter Alpha squadron broke off from the Frigate Jubelt 1 to engage the fleeing cargo vessel, Old Glory.
<br>
<br>"Captain, we spot rebel ships coming in at point 2.105, they have a YT-2400 with turbolasers. Requesting Frigate to assist."
<br>
<br>"Negative Lieutenant, we need to hold our position should the Bogenschmidt fall. If that cargo ship is too much to handle, then tender your resignation. Over and out."
<br>
<br>The Lieutenant leading the Alpha squadron shook his head with disgust. "Alpha 2, 3, and 4, engage the YT-2400, put power to front deflectors. Alpha 5, and 6 follow me. We are going to take out this cargo ship and get back to the Jubelt 1 asap."
<br>
<br>"Roger." They all replied.
<br>
<br>"Lieutenant, this is Alpha 2. Alpha 3, 4, and myself are starting our run on the YT-2400."
<br>
<br>"Copy." The Lieutenant, covered by Alpha 5 and 6, engaged booster engines to catch up to the cargo vessel.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Awna Dreamwealder led DarkStar Squadron in the YT-2400, accompanied by co-pilot Steex, a droid that had served Wolverine well throughout the years.
<br>
<br>"Lady Awna, scum dead ahead. Three by my count, standard Tie Fighters." Steex informed as he swilved back and forth between the control panel and the foreword weapon station. Awna laughed everytime she heard him say 'scum' as reference to Imperials. It was something Wolverine programmed into him from the beginning.
<br>
<br>"DarkStar, watch out ahead. We got three Tie Fighters engaging."
<br>
<br>"Copy," DarkStar 1-5 replied. "Pattern X in 3, 2, 1." DarkStar squadron broke off from behind the YT-2400, and slingshotted far around the Tie Fighters. They came up just out of firing range of the Tie Fighters back.
<br>
<br>Steex chirped again. "We are taking fire Lady Awna. Scum managed to temporarily disable our top turret. Our side, bottom, and foreword turbolasers are still functional."
<br>
<br>"Just need to hold them off for just a second." Awna muttered as she barrelrolled the YT-2400 away from the Tie Fighters bombardment.
<br>
<br>DarkStar 5-1 led the assault on the three Tie Fighters once Awna got clear of fire. The X-Wing assault took out two Tie Fighters instantly, and left the third disabled for Awna to finish off.
<br>
<br>"Alright boys, we have to reach the Old Glory fast. It is still 10 minutes from the Payback at its slow speed." She glanced over her shoulder, Steex was swiveling around again.
<br>
<br>"Need to repair the top turret, charge deflectors, when will I ever get a chance to recharge?" The droid spoke to itself in a quiet manner.
<br>
<br>"Steex."
<br>
<br>"Yes Lady Awna?"
<br>
<br>"Take us to the Old Glory asap. This struggle isn't nearly over yet."
<br>
<br>"At once." Steex engaged the engines at full blast, nearly having Awna fall out of her seat.
<br>
<br>"Dreamwealder to Old Glory Cargo Vessel, hang in there. Help is on the way."
<br>
<br>
<br>Wolverine took the High Admiral's message. "Sir, good to see you're back and well. We are currently getting the Payback in position to bombard the Corvette and it's two Tie Fighter squadrons in a crossfire match. My wife, Awna along with DarkStar Squadron is currently in their own dogfight with another Frigate's Tie Squadron in attempts to save Skywaler, Johnson and Peters from a grim fate in the cargo vessel. The vessel we were going to use to capture the pirates until High Command ended that plan by launching us at the refueling station asap."

"Sorry,Commodore.but the orders are still on the Payback,and I'm in command of the green sqadron on the Payback on the assualt on the refueling station when I get back.That what fleet HQ said in the orders."

<br>"Dreamwealder to Old Glory Cargo Vessel, hang in there. Help is on the way."
<br>"copy that Dreamwealder,this is Commander Skywaler and please get here,the sheilds won't last long.Commander Skywaler out."
<br>After Mike said that two more Ties came in and blasted the number two engine off.Hold togetheir baby Mike thought as he saw Darkstar squadron and the YT-2400 Dreamwealder.Then Mike got back on the com link with Wolverine.
<br>"Plus Commodre,I can't head back to the Perdator right now.We are in the middle of a battle and we are going to win this battle.Commodore can you have green squadron ready so we can end this little engagment with the Imperials here.Plus what does green squadron fly so when I get in my x-wing I can be in the same speed as them when we engage the frigates and Tie fighters."
<br>Mike switch channel real quick to contact Dreamwelder.
<br>"Old Glory to Dreamwelder this is Commande Skywaler again.We just lost our number two engine.Plesase get us back to the Payback so we can repair Old Glory and help you out taking out the Ties and the frigates,Commander Skywaler out."

"DarkStar 2nd and 3rd flights follow me in, Let's show these Predator rookies what real flying looks like!"
<br>
<br>As Ash ended the Comm he chuckled slightly at the cheers from the rest of the squadron and pushed forward on the stick until Old Glory lined up with his HUD.
<br>
<br>"Alright people we go in, in formation, shields double front and lasers on quad after that just stick with your wingman and have fun, Bacca your with me the rest of you know the drill"
<br>
<br>Bacca acknowledged but Ash knew he'd have to watch out for the newbie as so far he'd seen little real action. Shooting forwards in wedge formation the fighter's charged into the fray firing again and again decimating ties before they even saw them, then they broke out of formation and engaged the ties one-on-one. Ash grinned, before the end of the day he'd have plenty more Tie kills to paint on his cockpit.

The Imperial commander had been thinking this would be a rather routine mission...and he almost hated routine missions. Sometimes, he wished for more excitement...more enjoyment out of his command. However, no excitement meant that the Rebellion...yes, in his mind, they were still an insurgent group...even if they had been in power for a number of years...had found them. He was about to relax when he heard the alarms going off on the station. From a few meters sounh of him, his bridge officier began to speak...
<br>
<br>Lt. Raedon: "Captain...we got trouble. Two rebel groups have jumped into system...and they mean business. Orders?"
<br>
<br>Captain Jeremy Zeltar thought for a few moments...almost seeming to be deep in thought...when a second question woke him from the trance...
<br>
<br>Lt. Raedon: "Captain? Orders?"
<br>
<br>His head snapped up, and he spoke...his face almost seemed...excited to find the day brightened by a little action. He gave his orders in a crisp, clear voice...
<br>
<br>"Get those freighters fueled as soon as possible, and scramble the TIE fighters. Call in the Zadolt Ferra and Jubelt I for support, and have the Bogenschmidt cover the already refueled freighters. Tell them to get out of here as soon as possible...we will provide what cover we can. You have your orders."
<br>
<br>The bridge of the station began a flurry of activities as he sat down in his chair...beginning to assess the situation. The Zadolt Ferra moved to put itself between the Payback and the station, as the Jubelt I mirrored it's movements...giving the invaiders a long profile of themselves...which exposed them to both the turbolasers of the invaiders...but also afforded them a whole side to fire from. The battle would now begin in earnest...

The ten fueled freighters started to move. They were triing to fly pretty close to the station to the other side of the platform, to have the platform between them and the Republican units before jumping into hyperspace. Seemed they didn't want to wait for the other freighters to jump.
<br>
<br>Sure the Imperial commander protested, but he had other things to do and if the freighters would manage to jump into hyperspace he would have less ships to protect.
<br>
<br>Some smaller shuttles and transporters were also leaving the platform, triing to escape.

Awna Dreamwealder broke off from DarkStar Squadron to escort the Old Glory back to the CRS Payback as soon as the chasing Tie Fighters were decimated. Dreamwealder to Commander Skywaler, youre clear of enemy fighters. Make your way back on the double, I have my assurances that Green Squadron is prepped and ready for your arrival in docking bay 2.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Commodore Wolverine was still giving out orders by the time High Admiral Sifi reached the bridge.
<br>
<br>"Sir, the Corvette is shifting its position so the Frigate Jubelt 1 can cover them." The Lieutenant spoke earnestly. "Also, Featippa Fuel Station turbolasers are being charged."
<br>
<br>"Copy." Wolverine looked around and nodded at the High Admiral. "Lieutenant, take the Payback to intercept the Corvette's retreat. Make sure we are shielded from the stations turbolasers."
<br>
<br>"Understood, ensign. Take us to coordinates 4.215 by 32.1563 and relay orders to disable the Corvette Bogenschmidt."
<br>
<br>"Copy, wait a second! Lieutenant, the convoy is making a run to the nearest jump point behind the station." The ensign remarked.
<br>
<br>Wolverine looked on the screen, the ensign was right. He tapped his comlink, "Awna. How far out are you?"
<br>
<br>"Less than three minutes, why?" She replied.
<br>
<br>Wolverine looked over to High Admiral Sifi. "Sir, it's been an honor commanding this war vessel. However, we both know it's time for me to try to stop that convoy from escaping." With that, Commodore Wolverine walked from the bridge to meet his wife in their YT-2400.

"Copy that.Thanks Dreamwelder."
<br>After landing in hanger bay 2 Mike ran off Old Glory and headed to his fight at the sametime yelling at green squadron members.
<br>"All right boys get in the air now,we have a battle to win.Pick your targets when you get out there and help tak out the Corvette that is in retreat.Flight group one you with me when I get out there.May the force be with you."
<br>"yes,sir."they all yell and boarding their fighters and taking off.
<br>Mike went to his x-wing and took off after his sqaud mates.Mike got on the squadron channel to give some more orders.
<br>"Ok,flight group one and two form aroud me.We are going to take out those turbolasers on that station.Flights three and four go take out that retreating corvette."
<br>"Copy Green leader."
<br>Mike watch as the sqaudron went in different directions.He flew his fighter stright forward at the station at the same time taking out Tie fighters getting in his way.Then Mike got on the com channel to contact Darkstar
<br>1-2.
<br>"Green leader to Darkstar 1-2,can you send a flight over to help us take out those turbolasers on that damn station.At the same time stop those freighters from jumping into hyperspace.Ash nice little comment about us.Some of us perdator pilots are not rookies at all."

<p class="text"> 
The three freighters that were docked at the station had broken up the refuelling process, just with enough fuel to make a single jump out, they tried to catchup with the fueled freighters that were meanwhile below the station. So the way was free for the turbolasers of the station. When Green Squadron had reached the station they got nailed between station, corvette and Delta squadron, that moved there to help station and corvette. They managed to take down half of delta squadrons with missles but at the cost of half of green squadron. Many of the remaining fighters of Green squadron were damaged. Darkstar squadron had been close behind Green squadron before they got encoutered. They managed to take out for of the TIE Fighters in the first seconds with assault missles, but in close combat the Remnants used their far larger numbers to take out a few fighters of Dark Squadron as well.
<br>
<br>The Payback was a few minutes away from the corvette but encoutered from both sides from the two frigates. At the beginning the payback got hit hard, cause it wasn't in right position to use all, but when the ship advanced a bit on it's move it was able to strike the frigates better. The shield of all ships sunk below 80 percent.
<br>
<br>The 7 remaining freighters were triing to move onto the other side of the plaform as well to stay out of the range of the Calamari Cruiser.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
DarkStar Squadron kept close to the station to avoid the turbolaser fire while they finished off Delta squadron. The Frigate Jubelt 1 engaged it's engines to dart across the station, and towards the CRS Payback's back side in hopes of disabling the Mon Calamari Cruiser's engines.
<br>
<br>"CRS Payback to DarkStar Leader."
<br>
<br>Wolverine tapped the comlink. "Go ahead Payback."
<br>
<br>"We have initiated contact with the Corvette Bogenschmidt, it won't be long before they either are destroyed or make the jump to lightspeed. The main problem is that the Frigate Jubelt 1 is making an advancement towards our rear, we believe they are going to attempt to disable our warp drive so the convoy can escape. Stop them at all costs."
<br>
<br>"Copy that Payback." Wolverine twisted his seat towards Steex. "Steex, relay to the rest of the Squadron and Black Omega Squadron of the Payback's dilemna, and to get there on the double."
<br>
<br>The droid got up from the weapons station and darted over to the comlink station. "DarkStar and Omega Squadron, 87 over to the Frigate Jubelt 1 in attack pattern Delta. Stop the ship from reaching the Payback's warp drive."
<br>
<br>Wolverine and Awna heard a bunch of replies from both squadrons. "Right, let's assist." He punched the YT-2400 into a barrel roll to avoid the Station's turbolasers as they seared past DarkStar Squadron and himself.
<br>
<br>"Black Omega Leader to DarkStar Leader, we are coming up on your position. Be advised, the Frigate Jubelt 1 has released a Tie Squadron towards your position. I count twelve fighters in total."
<br>
<br>"Copy that." Awna replied. "Steex, charge the turrets and get ready for a bumpy ride."
<br>
<br>"At once Lady Awna!" The droid alerted the weapons system of the turret activation and the targetting protocols. "Turrets online and standing by."
<br>
<br>"Wonderful!" Wolverine gasped as he saw the Beta Tie Squadron disperse torpedoes towards their location. He slammed the comlink. "Evasive manuevers, evasive manuevers!"
<br>
<br>Awna yanked the controls to plunge the YT-2400 under the incoming torpedoes. "We got two trailing us."
<br>
<br>"Steex, target them and open fire!" Wolverine yelled.
<br>
<br>"Copy, one destroyed. Other is being tricky."
<br>
<br>A chatter of screams came over the comlink. "DarkStar 5-1 and 5-3 are down!" Wolverine shuttered at the sound, even after all his years in war, it never was something he got used to.
<br>
<br>The YT-2400 passed the Frigate Jubelt 1 as the torpedo trailed it. Awna managed to fly close enough to the Frigate for the torpedo to slam into it's side.
<br>
<br>"We are clear of torpedoes sir." Steex delcared with a volume of victory.
<br>
<br>A blast shook the ship, Awna looked over to Wolverine. "Ready?"
<br>
<br>"You know I'm ready to follow you anywhere, lead away." Wolverine smirked. Awna and him had been closer since she'd had their daughter a month prior. They decided to name her Kelly Dreamwealder.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>The Corvette Bogenschmidt kept it's firepower to maximum as the CRS Payback edged closer to paralleling itself. This would give the Payback full use of it's side batteries.
<br>
<br>"Captain, we won't be able to hold out much longer under their firepower. Request permission to jump into hyperspace?" The Lieutenant Commander asked.
<br>
<br>The Captain shook his head, "we must allow the convoy enough time to escape before we make our jump."
<br>
<br>"They won't make before we are ripped to shreds."
<br>
<br>"Then so be it!" The Captain punched the LC down the bridge steps. "If we go down, we go down in the glory of battle. The one thing I will not tolerate is cowardice on my ship. Anyone tries anything to stop my orders." The Captain withdrew a blaster. "You will pay dearly." He looked at the bridge crew. "Turn the ship around to face the Payback and ram it."
<br>
<br>"Captain?" The crew asked.
<br>
<br>The Captain flung his blaster around. "Do it or you'll die by my hand. That warship being destroyed will aid the war effort magnificiently for the Remant. Follow orders now!"
<br>
<br>"Aye aye."
<br>
<br>The Captain smiled as the Corvette Bogenschmidt turned to meet the Mon Calamarian Crusier CRS Payback head on.

"Green leader to Darkstar Leader.I just lost green squadron from the attack on the station.The station is now disable and we won't worry about their guns again.I'm heading your way and lets take out those frigates."
<br>Mike turned his xwing around so he can head towards Wolverine postion.At the same time he was balst Tie fighter out of his way and at the same time not tring to get himself kill.Then to portside he saw another frieghter being ingolf in flams.
<br>Mike took out another Tie after watch the fire works of exploing frieghter.

The shields of the Corvette Bogenschmidt were dropping fast. Front shields had already been down for second a few laser bolts from the Payback had burned parts of the hull, but the corvette moved energy from weapons and rear shields into front shield and so the corvette recovered 20% front shields that would let then survive another few moments.
<br>
<br>Attacked from the two frigates and the corvette, the shields of the Payback had meanwhile dropped to below 50 percent, but two squadrons were already been amunitioned and deployed, ready to attack the frigates, torpedos were going to be loaded into two more squadrons.
<br>
<br>The frigates recovered a bit while the Payback was concentrating fire against the corvette. The had 60 to 65 percent shield remaining.
<br>
<br>Green squadron had meanwhile taken out several TIE Fighters and parts of the station defenses but under the cost of wiping out Green squadron. Commander Skywaler's fighter had already been damaged in the combat with the platform. He already had reached the range of the Payback when a single TIE Fighter that had followed him and fired some laser bolts against it's target.
<br>
<br>Mike mentioned all kind of alarm lights glowing up in his cockpit and remnants of two wings of his X-Wing drifting away from the fighter.
<br>
<br>The fueled freighters had meanwhile reached the other sides of the platform and were seconds away from the hyperspace position.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Captain Zeltar, on board the platform, began barking out orders. he was the type that was cool in a combat situation, and he also expected to be followed. There were several of the non-combat hardened ensigns and lower ranks that were panicking...and that was a bad sign. His voice rang out clear and true...
<br>
<br>"Listen up. I want all the station's firepower focused on the largest ship. I want their shields down as soon as possible...if it is even possible. Tell the Bogenschmidt to get with those freighters...and get out of here as soon as it can. It is worse than useless right now...it will end up getting herself blasted. Tell the Zalton Ferra and the Jublet I to move to cover the refueling freighters...and concentraite their firepower on the largest ship out there. If we can damage it somewhat, we will break their spirit. You have your orders...proceed."
<br>
<br>He sat back down into the Captain's chair, and sighed softly, the Imperial commander seeming out of sorts...or was it he was just worried. This depot, if it fell, would cause some supply problems in this sector...and that would mean his command, if he was lucky. He had to stop that from happening...if he could at all possible.

<p class="text">
Fire in the hole, seemed to be the slogan of the hour in the CRS Paybacks turret stations. Hundreds of Rebel workers put their souls into the job of keeping the turrets and weapons activated and working properly.
<br>
<br>We got incoming Frigate on the left, codename Zadolt Ferra. They are easy to spot; they are covering the fueling frigates. The ensign pointed out at the station.
<br>
<br>The crew worked to aim the turrets towards the Zadolt Ferra and open fire. The Frigates shields just fell below 82 percent with those well aimed blasts, lets keep at it people! The deck commander beckoned relentlessly.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Black Omega Squadron formed their A-Wings into attack formation as they trailed the fleeing corvette, Bogenschmidt, which was attempting to migrate away from the CRS Payback.
<br>
<br>Black Leader to Green Leader, Black 3-1 and 3-2 are in route to you. Your ship is damaged and needs repairs, keep that Tie off your tail long enough for help to arrive. Buran said quickly as he drew his remaining squadron towards the Corvette.
<br>
<br>Black 2-1 to Black Leader, we got Ties inbound from the fueling station. Their estimated time until contact, two minutes.
<br>
<br>Two minutes, Buran thought. That was more than enough time to disable the Corvette and dodge the Tie Fighters. Copy that. Black 2 Team, begin your run. Aim for the warp drive. Black 3 Team, standby for your run immediately after. Aim for the engines.
<br>
<br>Buran heard a bunch of copy that Black Leader go out over the comlink. Black Leader to Dark Leader, we got seven fleeing convoy ships on the other side of the station. Can you get to them in time?
<br>
<br>Affirmative, we just disabled the Frigate Jubelt 1s engines before they could flank the CRS Payback. We are in route right now.
<br>
<br>Copy that. Buran watched Team 2 and 3 devastate the warp drive and engines of the Corvette Bogenschmidt, grinding the fleeing vessel to a halt.
<br>
<br>Black Leader, we got enemies at three oclock!
<br>
<br>Buran led Team 1 into the dogfight ahead. Kill them all!
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Sir, we cant stand much more of that rapid firepower. Our shields cant regenerate quickly enough. Steex noted as he continued to work the weapons station flawlessly, the turbolasers on the YT-2400 kept a steady pace of beating on the Frigate Jubelt 1.
<br>
<br>Awna let out a steady breath as she eased the YT-2400 through a series of tests with the Imperial Frigate. They are almost within range of the Paybacks warp drive.
<br>
<br>Wolverine targeted the Jubelt 1s shield generator and jettisoned two torpedoes towards it. They floated through space at a decent pace, Jubelt 1 attempted to disable the torpedoes before they met their mark, but failed. The Jubelt 1 lost their shields and was open to attack. They are turning back towards the fueling station, they know we have them!
<br>
<br>Awna smirked. Dreamwealder to DarkStar Squadron, the Jubelt 1s shields are down, repeat the shields are down.
<br>
<br>Wolverine and Awna watched as the Jubelt 1s engines were disabled after a few passing runs. The Tie Fighters they were fighting earlier quickly got decimated by Black Omega Squadron before they headed to attack the Corvette.
<br>
<br>Black Leader to Dark Leader, we got seven fleeing convoy ships on the other side of the station. Can you get to them in time?
<br>
<br>Wolverine looked on the screen and Awna tapped the movement with her finger. There, she motioned.
<br>
<br>Affirmative, we just disabled the Frigate Jubelt 1s engines before they could flank the CRS Payback. We are in route right now.
<br>
<br>Never get a break, do we? She flung her long brunette hair over her shoulder.
<br>
<br>Wolverine eased back into his chair. Guess not. He tapped the comlink. DarkStar Squadron, this is your leader. Form up; we are going after the fleeing convoy. The Payback will no doubt make short work of the Jubelt 1 and Bogenschmidt. The Zadolt Ferra has better chance. Expect heavy resistance by the Zadolt Ferra until we cross the station. If Green Squadron was successful in their run, the station will be disabled turret wise. Awna and Wolverine plunged the YT-2400 towards their destination, in hopes this wasnt suicide. May the force be with us all, he heard Awna whisper.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>It wasnt clear what exactly was going on for the Captain of the Corvette Bogenschmidt. The ship has been ground to a halt by the pesky A-Wings trailing them, leaving them open bait to bombardment or boarding.
<br>
<br>Captain Ike tapped the comlink. This is your Captain speaking, everyone arm themselves. I fear since we arent being bombarded, the rebels are preparing a boarding party. He ended the transmission and walked back to the bridge viewport. The Tie Squadron had just intercepted and taken out two of the A-Wings. Good, one less rebel scum in the universe, Ike thought to himself quietly. The news came rolling in fast over the sector comlink, the Frigate Jubelt 1 as well as the Fueling Station turrets had been disabled along with his ship. The Frigate Zadolt Ferra was losing shields, but holding near the station, and the convoy was getting ready for the jump to lightspeed.
<br>
<br>So much loss in one day, Warlord Horus will be very displeased. He looked back out the viewport and saw a volley of lasers sour past his ship at the dogfight below. They were all well targeted shots, because no Tie Fighter was left flying. Captain Ike watched the A-Wings fly back away. Prepare for boarding in less than three minutes, he said to his crew over the comlink. He then relayed a message to the station. This is Captain Ike of the Corvette Bogenschmidt, we are being boarded.
<br>
<br>He looked up through the viewport once more to see the bottom of the Mon Calamarian Cruiser arch itself into view. The CRS Payback halted its position, seeming to concentrate its firepower towards the Frigate Zadolt Ferra while activating its tractor beams to bring the Bogenscmidt in for boarding.
<br>
<br>Captain Ike looked up as the approaching doom and cocked his blaster. Death never tasted so sweet.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>The crossfire between the Zadolt Ferra and the CRS Payback led to a quick escape from a confrontation with the Imperial Frigate for DarkStar Squadron. Awna led them around the station and slingshot towards the convoy. Easy boys, we want to disable the convoy, not destroy it unless necessary to avoid escape.
<br>
<br>We copy, Flight 2 and 3 going in for our run, was heard over the comlink as two X-Wings took the lead to fire stun bolts at the convoy ships. Four convoy ships are disabled.
<br>
<br>Wolverine took control of the YT-2400 and checked the status on the remaining three. The other three are preparing to jump into hyperspace. Make your shot count.
<br>
<br>Flight 2 and 3 quickly swung around to make another run when the three convoy ships jumped into hyperspace. No!
<br>
<br>Steex, track their hyperspace route. It still has to be around, they just jumped. Wolverine ordered.
<br>
<br>Steex swung over to the data station and tapped the console. Got it, inputting coordinates.
<br>
<br>Wolverine relayed the coordinates to the rest of DarkStar Squadron, on my mark, 3, 2, 1. DarkStar Squadron jumped into hyperspace after the convoy, leaving Flight 2 behind to guard the disabled convoy.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Lets get us some Imp scum! The rebel soldiers all yelled in triumph as they prepared to breach the doors of the Corvette Bogenschmidt which was now beamed to the Payback.
<br>
<br>The task was quick and simple, the door fell and Rear Admrial Pat led the charge into the Corvettes hallway. A few laser bolts flew in his direction as he ducked for cover and returned a few shots back. Show no mercy if they fail to show none. He ordered as rebel soldiers poured into the hallway. A few of them fell as the Remnant kept up their resistance, failing to give the rebels one inch of ground. This was no mans land.
<br>
<br>Cover me, Im going in. Ensign Adrian Kiarey yelled as he flung a proton grenade off the nearby wall, into the enemy fortified line. The stormtroopers flew in all directions as the blast shook the ship. The ceiling fell through and blocked the entrance from ahead.
<br>
<br>Smart thinking Ensign, stick with the other group and take the east side of the ship. Im leading the western campaign.
<br>
<br>Copy that. Ensign Kiarey flung around the corner to see more rebels fall as the laser battle had just begun.

Black Leader to Green Leader, Black 3-1 and 3-2 are in route to you. Your ship is damaged and needs repairs, keep that Tie off your tail long enough for help to arrive.
<br>"Copy,that hurry up boys I can't last long and my fighter is heavily damge from my bold attack on the refuel station.Damn,boys hurry up I just lost both of my port and starboard upper wings."
<br>Mike had to close the s-foils so he won't lose the other two remaining wings.Damn it I souldn't have attack that station head on with my squadron Mike thought at the same time contacting the Payback.
<br>"Commander Skywaler to Payback I'm coming in hot and my fighter is heavily damage."
<br>"Copy that Commander."
<br>Just then Mike saw two a-wings coming his way and blasted the Tie fighter off his tail.
<br>"Black 3-1 to Commander Skywaler, land now and get repairs done.You are clear and we will follow you until you make it the haner bay two."
<br>"Copy that Black 3-1,I was already on my way to the hanger bay two and thanks for taking out that Tie."
<br>"Your weclome commander"
<br>Keeping the fighter on the same path towards the Payback Mike fought with the controls to keep her standy.So he can land in the hanger bay in one piece when he landed.In the hanger bay Mike got out the x-wing and went the Master Technician to talk to him.There was nothing left of Green Squadron after his bold attack on station which took out some of the stations defense.Mike was sad for his losts also he was wondering if his vice squadron commander made it back to the Payback.
<br>
<br>in the hanger bay two
<br>
<br>Mike stands near his fighter after he landed and watch tech crews going to work on his fighter.At the same time Mike contact the bridge to see if how the battle is going well he was waiting for his fighter to be repaired.
<br>"Commander Skywaler to Bridge,how many more frieghters are left and were did Darkstar squadron went."
<br>Mike asked about them because he saw them going after some frieghters that went into hyperspace when his squadron was attacking the station.
<br>"Bridge to Commander Skywaler Four convoy ships are disabled and three escaped.Darkstar went after them and will be back soon.Corvette Bogenschmidt is being boarded right now and frigate Zadolt Ferra shield are still at full strenght.Commander theres nothing you can do right now."
<br>"understood, Commander Skywaler out."
<br>Mike turn to the one of the hanger crew member and ask him how long till his fighters are ready.
<br>"How long tech till my fighter are ready."
<br>"two to a hour, sir"
<br>"Is there anything y'all need help with."
<br>"Commander I don't mind the help."
<br>Mike faced the other way and went to his fighter to help with the repairs.So he can be back out there and mop up anything that is still out there.

The thirteen freighters started to jump into hyperspace. So the Remnant commanders gave the emergency retreat orders, within seconds the frigates made mirco jumps out of the battle zones. Escape capsules were starting from the corvette and the seven remaining freighters, while the remaining personnel of the platform was triing to escape in two transports.

After a long wait Mike was back in his x-wing with whats left of his sqaudron.They were mobbing up the remaining Ties that stayed behind.Payback captured the corvette and has a boarding party on the Zadolt Ferra after Black Omega took out its shield but it fland before Payback was able to pull it in.Mike contated the Payback to let them know there was any more Ties in the area.
<br>"Commander Skywaler to Payback,everything is a rap.Promission to lead a boarding party on the refueling station and take some persioners from the station."
<br>Mike sat in his cockpit waiting for his answer while he did a fly by on the corvette,and the Payback.Which to Mike it was a cost to gain one more ships for the New Republic.His scan were beeping and showing friendlies coming in from hyperspace.

Captain Jeremy Zeltar remained on the bridge as the rest of the crew began to abandon the station. He had ordered them off the station when the other freighters had taken off. Alone, damaged, and crest-fallen...he had little choice now. He could go out in a blaze of glory...or a whimper of defeat. In the high-time of the Empire, there would have been no choice...failure would mean death either way. Now...was capture such a horrible option? Or should he try and take the ships out with him...and blow the station? He had some time to think about it, as he began inputting the code for the station's destruction. Standing on the bridge...the countdown began...with a siren and a claxion over the loudspeakers and over the subspace channels...
<br>
<br>"Ten minutes until station destruction. All hands to the docking bay for immediate departure."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
"Negative Green Leader, the station has begun a self-destruct sequence. Stand down." A voice from the Payback came through.

Thes stirred and looked around his cockpit, 'What the hell caused that short.' he thought. Looking over his diagnostics his stomach tightened. "Shields out, sensors out, engines 3 & 4 out, hyperdrive out, weapons out, great this is going good so far. R5?" Thes looked behind him and saw his astromech was fried as well. "Stang! I have no clue where I am at, lets see, hmm," Thes pulled up his tactical screen, and it flickered with sparks shooting out the panel. "Well, at least I can send a distress beacon out, seems as though I never made it to the rendevious point." Clicking the record button Thes spoke, "This is LT Commander Thes Nazud, New Republic 5th Fleet, my ship is disabled and I am adrift, I have activated my rescue beacon and set it to send out with this message, please respond." Thes, shut don the recording and set it to play in a loop. 'Well,' he thought, 'at least I can send a force call to Master Wolverine and let him know I am in trouble.' Thes proceeded to shut down all unneccesary systems and enter a meditative trance, and reached out to Wolverine.

Wolverine came back with Awna in the YT-2400, they emerged from hyperspace leaving debris everywhere around the battle sight.
<br>
<br>Awna picked up the incoming call from Commander Skywaler. "Seems he's wondering how our convoy hunt went."
<br>
<br>"Wolverine to Green Leader, the three convoys that fled were destroyed. The remaining four we disabled are being boarded and re-directed back to the CRS Payback." Just as Wolverine finished sending the transmission, a vision hit him and he fell out of his chair and to the floor.
<br>
<br>'Don't forget to take care of her.' Awna beckoned as she cried franticly after being dragged away. 'Master, she's gone!' Thes yanked Wolverine away from the viewport.
<br>'So, we meet for the last time.' A hooded figure weilding a red lightsaber walked towards Thes and Wolverine.
<br>
<br>"Wolverine!" Awna screamed as she shook her husband franticly. "Snap out of it."
<br>
<br>Steex threw a glass of water on Wolverine's face, but nothing stopped the vision.
<br>
<br>A moment later, Wolverine came to. He opened his eyes to see his droid getting ready to throw another cup of water at him. "I'm better, no need." Steex went back to his console frustrated.
<br>
<br>"What happened?" Awna asked worringly.
<br>
<br>Wolverine shook his head, "I had a vision of the future."
<br>
<br>"What's going to happen?"
<br>
<br>Wolverine looked down at the floor, narrowed his eyes and peered at Awna. "Bad things, I think it's best for you to head back to Coruscant and take care of Kelly."
<br>
<br>"Why? What did you see?"
<br>
<br>"Just trust me, please. I don't know what I would do if something happened to you." He grabbed the console board and peered out of the viewport, not bearing to look her dead in the eye.
<br>
<br>Awna sat back down in the chair. Thoughts rushed through her mind about the possible visions, obviously they either involved their daughter or her directly. Was this what got Wolverine so upset? She had no way to find out without him opening up, she would have to trust his judgement. "Alright, I'll take a shuttle back first thing in the morning."
<br>
<br>"Good." Suddenly, he felt Thes through the force calling for help. "Thes is calling for me through the force, his ships in pretty bad shape. Let's go help him out of this mess."

"Copy that standing down."
<br>Before Mike turn his fighter around to head back to the Payback.Mike contact Wolverine again.
<br>"Commander Skywaler to Dreamwelder,Wolverine I'm heading back to the Payback.With your promission I like to take a group of volunteers to patrol this area out.To see if there are any Imperial are any remaining in this area of space."

"Understood,I'll agree on that.Commander Skywaler out."
<br>Mike turn his fighter around so he was facing the Payback.Then he eased his fighter in for the landing in hanger bay two and shut down everything after he landed the x-wing.Mike got out of the x-wing and felt a sharp pain going through his body.So he lef the hanger bay and went to the infirmary so the Doc can check him out.

Captain Zeltar watched the various fighters and ships scramble away fromt he station...and a sly grin split his face. He would begin to power down the auto-destruct sequence. He had thought this had worked perfectly. However, he kept the sirens and the warnings going...so that the ships would think it was still in the self-destruct mode. He would opena channel to the other commanders further along the route...
<br>
<br>"Captain Zeltar to Command...Captain Zeltar to command."
<br>
<br>"Respond Zeltar."
<br>
<br>"Station here has failed to protect...10 freighters escaped, the Bogenschmidt has been disabled, and the other two have escaped with some damage. All remaining freighters have either been destroyed or disabled, and captured. Ships that attacked us are as follows..."
<br>
<br>A brief description of the attacking ships and the crew's appearent skill levels...he would then close the channel, and wait. Sooner of later, they would figure out the self-destruct had been stopped...especially when the 10 minute mark came and went...and no boom...

Ash shook off the last of the Ties into the Payback's point defence and heaved a sigh of relief, the fighting had been intense but they'd come through relatively unscathed. Glancing at his HUD Ash checked to see which Darkstars were still waiting to land, seeing that it was only 2nd flight still out he opened the flight comm.
<br>
<br>"Good job people land at your pleasure but keep frosty there might still be some Ties floating around"
<br>
<br>He waited until their acknowledgement lights flashed and then disobeying his own orders started the fighter's personal speakers playing some loud Zabrak music. He slouched in the chair with Bolts maintaining the Fighter's position until hangar space cleared.

After a hour or so in the Bacta Tank Mike got out and felt much beater.The doc came over to him and tell him what to do next time.

<br>"Yes,doc no worry and I'll follow your advice next time."

<br><br><b>The Asteroids of Anguna</b></p>

<center><img src="camphtgb.gif"></center>

<p class="text">
When Carrier Group Warspite had reached Anguna the Imperial convoi had almost reached the passage through the asteroids. Two Remnant corvettes Gollost and Adventure III were fliing ahead of a group of twenty freighters through the passage. The freighters had reduced speed for the formation flight through the passage. Two frigates Jubelt II and Jubelt III and the Corvette Abenteuer IV were covering the back of the convoi.
<br>
<br>Two TIE Fighter squadrons Rho and Sigma, that had the order to protect the passage directly identified the Republican arrivers and started to encounter them. Each of the frigate prepared to start the 4 TIE Fighter squadrons, Alpha, Beta Gamma and Delta.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
would just sigh softly as they entered hyperspace and exited, appearing right near the rather large convoy, Gene would softly shake his head
<br>
<br>SIR, radar shows we have two frigates, two corvettes, a bunch of freighters and 2 Tie squadrons, they are making their round about, they have us identified as Republican
<br>
<br>Well I guess it's time to bust the party up. Sound red alert. Raise shields and alert all anti-aircraft turrets to let loose. Launch all wings. Falcon to provide escort and cover the bombers while they make runs on those damn corvettes. Prepare torpedos and tell me when you get a lock on those frigates. Provide slight support for the fighters to get the hell out.
<br>
<br>before pausing for a moment....the force calling out to him...engine rumbles could be heard...more Ties perhaps? eyes closing slightly for a moment before reaching out...as if....touching the Frigate ship commanders....peering into their minds and speaking softly ~If we launch our tie suqadrons, we will not have cover in case the republicans break through, stand down all tie squadrons. We must push foreward at all cost~
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
The commander of the frigate felt some irritation but the crew of the frigate continued the procedure the have done thousants of times. Rho squadron united with the first deployed squadrons of the two frigate and build the 1st wave of fighters, they were still some kilometers away from the Warspite. Sigma squadron was on the other side of the asteroid belt and were currently preceeding through the passage. The first two corvettes massivly reduced speed entering the passage. The corvette and the frigates at the end of the covoi continued following the convoi while deploying the fighters, but they went into close formation with each other.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Raul was near the bridge when the orders went out, and he would lean assess the situation for a moent, before he would lean over, and speak to Gene...
<br>
<br>"Hey bossman...those two Corvettes are awfully close together...if we can get them to maneuver into one another...that would save us one huge headache. Or at least put them on the defensive. We need a surgical strike...take them out as soon as piossible, because those corvettes on the front end will get their heads lit up if they try to come back through the asteroid belt to defend."
<br>
<br>It was a simple strategy for him...but most times, the simpliest strategies were best. He also wasn't sure of his role in this just yet...after all, he was doing his best to get a grasp on his new rank...his new role.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
would be waching what was going on ahead when we heard Raul's voice and suggestion on tactic..before only smirking as he looked back
<br>
<br>Wing Commander, what in bantha spit are you doing on my bridge in the middle of an important mission? You get your butt down the flight deck and launch out with White. You are DISMISSED
<br>
<br>before turning back as he watched on radar the slowly building first wave of tie fighters, before nodding lightly
<br>
<br>Make sure all turrets are ready, I'm not in the mood for tie fighters to screw with my fighters while they take out those vettes with Raul's plan. They will be slowed down due to those freighters only able to go so fast. Prep all fighters and launch. I want my A-Wings to stay near the ship icnase any other fighters wish to tango. Continue moving us toward that bottleneck area and when we're able to, unleash a volley of photon torps.
<br>
<br>Right sir
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
The first wave of TIE Fighters reduced speed on half of the way between Warspite and the frigates waiting to intercept any an fighter and bomber that would pass their line to attack the convoi. The second wave of TIE Fighters was meanwhile assambling at the corvettes.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
the Warspite would continue moving towards that first wave of Tie Fighters, though not really mimding as Gene nodded to an officer
<br>
<br>Begin firing shots towards those Tie Fighters. Disrupt their waveness so we can get fighters and bombers through. I want acknowledgement when our fighters break through to begin their attack. Also, comm, send message to those Corvettes, Frigates, and Freighters, start, Now:
<br>
<br>the comm officer would nod as he flipped on a switch to attempt to establish communications with the ship commanders
<br>
<br>Imperial Remanant officers, I am Commodore Gene Starwind of the New Republic, I wish to make available to you that you may make out of this alive if you wish to surrender your ships to the Republic. In exchange, I will see that you are placed on worlds that are not extremely harsh. Failure to agree upon these terms will result in total destruction of every piece of your convoy. Your fate is in my hands, Imperial scum.
<br>
<br>nodding to flip it off before only shaking his head
<br>
<br>If they are true imperials, they will laugh and beckon me to fight them to the death...
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
Raul was down tot he flight deck in aflash...not exactly happy with the way he was spoken to...but, he let that pass. He just figured it was due to Gene's stress from this already taking place. At any rate, his E-wing was already prepped and ready for him by the time he hit the flight deck, and as more and more of the Warspite's fighters launched. He ascended the ladder, hopped into the cockpit, and put his helmut on. His R-unit beeped to him, and he spoke back...
<br>
<br>"Back in the saddle again, eh? We are in for a wild ride my friend...just keep the status of the fighters constantly updated, and I'll worry about the rest. Also, channel 2 I want a direct connection to the bridge here...that way, I don't have to fight with finding the right signal...understood?"
<br>
<br>His R-unit beeped affirmation of his orders, and as the cockpit swung shut, he was already in launch mode...beginning to wing his way out of the hangar bay. He hit space flying, his voice crackling through the comm traffic...
<br>
<br>"Alright, listen up folks. I want you to engage those TIEs...keep them off of our Y-wing's backs. Y-wings...you know the drill. Call out your targets...and if you get into trouble...don't hesitate to ask for help. May the Force be with us."
<br>
<br>Into the fray he went...one of the more advanced fighters out there...but that came with his status. It was his duty to run the fighter offensive, and the defenses...should it come to that.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
The first wave of TIE Fighters moved closer to the frigates again when the Warspite came nearer to their position. They tried to stay out of the weapons range of the Warpite and prepared to engage the Republican fighters and bombers.
<br>
<br>The second wave of TIE Fighters was meanwhile close to the first one. The first two freighters were short before entering the passage.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
watched as the ties just moved back a tiny bit when the enormous capitaol shipped moved foreward, being rather...well....slow. Gene's eyes watching the radar as he only shook his head
<br>
<br>Come on Bombers, light those frigates up. Afterwards, hit on those freighters.....
<br>
<br>growing just alittle bit anxious as he watched the fight pursue, his turrets launching out volleys of lasers, before looking towards one of his officers
<br>
<br>Range till we can launch torpedos at those frigates and freighters?
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
In the field, Raul was getting his troops ready for their bombing runs. His squads of X-wings began an escort formation around the bombers, while the occasional pair broke to take care of a few TIEs that ventured too close. As the first group came up to the freighters, the Y-wings began to fire off sets of torpedoes, lighting the freighters up. He was with the second group, making sure things were going smoothly enough.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
Captain Pralev stood on the bridge of the Corvette Gollost, his Corvette, and turned slightly as the Comms officer approached. The ensign was nervous and for once it wasn't because of the Captain's cold nature or even the dark appearance he shared with all Chiss.
<br>
<br>"Speak Ensign"
<br>
<br>"Sir... The rebels just transmitted this message"
<br>
<br>The ensign handed Pralev a datapad which he glanced at it and for a moment the Captain let his emotions show, Anger. In one motion he passed the datapad back and turned on the spot towards the front of the cockpit,
<br>
<br>"Helmsman hold close formation slow engines and coordinate with Adventure three on overlapping point defence, All hands red alert, today we fight for all the comrades lost to these petty criminals their deaths shall not be in vain"
<br>
<br>The bridge crew looked towards their captain and as one saluted before turning back to their stations, he grimly returned the salute and as the lights faded he made a silent vow to destroy these traitors to the Empire.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commander Ash Halcyon</p>
<p class="text">
When Republican fighters and bombers reached half of the way between the Warspite and the convoi all TIE Fighters started to attack fighter and bomber squadron at the same time.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Raul would snap his E-wing over in a roll, the Corellian Jedi speaking through the com-link to the other fighters...
<br>
<br>"Evasive! X-wings...cover those Y-wings. Y-wings...do your best to take out those freighters! Warspite...that Corvette is up to something...I don't like it one bit."
<br>
<br>The X-wings under his command would begin to engage the TIE fighters...and while, individually, they were a stronger group than ther TIEs themselves, they had several advantages...their home turf...their numbers...and that would keep the tide about even. Raul himself had been hit afew times by passing laser beams, but his shields were stronger than the other fighters, and they were still holding at about 50%. He had taken out a few fighters himself, and save for two, the Y-wings were somewhat protected. They had only engaged the TIEs on a need-to basis...focusining on their bombing runs on the freighters.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
Five freighters had been destroyed by the torpedo runs. The engines of a sith freighter had been seriously damaged so he drifted into the asteroid belt. Three more freighters had lost shields and smaller hull damages but continued their flight through the passage. Two more freighters had weakened shields.
<br>
<br>The fighter squadrons had dealt with the TIE Fighters meanwhile. More then half of the fighters had been destroyer while half a dozend of the others slipped through the passage to get back to the space fortress for repairs. The remaining had retreated into the weapons range of the frigates. But also the Republican Units suffered losses. Eight fighters had been shot down. Eleven more had returned to the Warspite for repairs.
<br>
<br>The bombers meanwhile passed the way pretty savely. One of them had been shot down, two more of them heavily damaged passing the frigates weapons range moving through the convoi. But meanwhile most of them had fired all their torpedos against the freighters. Only a few had one or two tropedos remaining.
<br>
<br>The frigates meanwhile had changed were fireing on the wrecks of the freighters blocking the entrance of the passage, cause they weren't able to jump into hyperspace so close to an asteroid belt.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Raul had taken some damage himself, but his ship was a newer and stronger fighter than most had in this. As they blasted the wreckage to block the passage, he smirked. He wasn't sure exactly on what he should, do, so he flipped his com to the Warspite's channel...
<br>
<br>"Streak to Warspite...respond please. We can no longer safely pursue the remaining fighters, and most of our bombers are dry. Advise."
<br>
<br>The remaning fighters had drawn back, out of the frigate's laser range...after all, it wasn't their place to engage the frigates...to do so would be suicide. So, as they regrouped, and Raul took in an estimate of the number of fighters lost and damaged...he waited for the reply.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
The Republic had lost eight fighters and 1 bomber, but together with the damaged fighters in the repair hangars they had almost two squadrons knocked out. The Imperials had less then 2 TIE Fighters squadrons remaining in defense position around the frigates. Bomber squadrons had meanwhile been loaded with warheads again. Most of them had already left the hangars while half a dozend were ready to take off.
<br><br>
<br>The B-Wings had completely been deployed and had started with their second run on the freighters.
<br><br>
<br>The remaining convoi was meanwhile proceeded to far on it's way through the passage and was in reach of the reinforcements, so the bombers turned to another target. The fighters of the Warspite were able to protect the bombers against the rest of the Imperial fighter defence and the bombers placed their torpedows on the two frigates. Most of the warheads stroke the Jubelt III, taking out shields first, then braking holes into hull and at least taking out engines and power supply. The remaining guns on the frigate stopped fireing and the lights turned out one after the other. Escape pods shuttles and transports started from the frigate. The Jubelt II meanwhile had lost more then half of its shield power. The Abenteuer IV started to slip through the wrecks in the entry of the passage, the Jubelt II tried to follow the corvette, but the container area of an destroyed freighter hit the frigate while passing the derbis field and broke the frigate into two pices. The Imperials started to evacuate that ship as well while the Republican task force was returning into hyperspace again.

<br><br><b>Back in Ogompak</b>
<br>
<br>Much later, the fleet was assambled at Ogompak again. The Carrier Groups Zentar, Warspite and Payback had returned through a hyperjump after completing their missions.
<br>
<br>Republican divisions from the Battlegroup One stardestroyers and the freighters of the convoi had started a global invasion on Ogompak III some hours ago. With support from the Republican battleships in the orbit and their fighters in the air the Republican ground forces had driven off theit Remnant counterparts from many key positions on the surface. The Remnant forces had meanwhile fortified their positions and the progress of the ground forces had slowed down
