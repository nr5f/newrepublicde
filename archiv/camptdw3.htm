So far sir our bombers are on course, only two have been hit by crossfire from one of those smaller corvettes, we're receiving help from the Predator with this...whoa!

"Warspite thanking for the help, the Frigate is destroyed."
<br>
<br>"No problem, tell them to focus their fire on the corvettes and anti-fighter ships. We need them desotroyed to make sure our bombers can turn to the capital ships later. What's the status on our squadrons and the fortress?"
<br>
<br><i>Van didn't like being worried about his pilots so much but he felt much more responsable for them than usual, with them being so inexperienced and young.</i>

Sir, Predator's bombers are returning back, shields on the fortress to 20%, our bombers are beginning their bombing runs now, next will the BG I's heavy bombers
<br>
<br>Good, continue concentrating fire on those corvettes and anti-fighter ships, we'll be needing our bombers for those large capital ships, primarly to knock out that interdictor class so when we retreat it'll be easier

<br>Alright, redirect power from that engine to shields, as long as we've got shields wee're still in the running
<br>
<br>Sir, bomber group reporting that the shields are broken for the BG I's heavy bombers to finish the mission, they are returning back, any orders from them?
<br>
<br>Tell them to direct bomber attack on that interdictor class, primarilty those gravity wells.  Fighter groups can slack off alittle bit on protecting and help eagle chase down those bombers.

<br>"Lucius wanted to hunt bombers, now's his chance. Cobalt after enemy bombers and Auric returns to the Predator for rearmament."
<br>
<br><i>The Predator shook slightly, apparently a bomber squadron had unloaded torpedoes and afew had exploded on the shields.</i>
<br>

<br>
<br><i>He twisted his X-wing into a flight path back towards the incoming bomber groups...which didn't like that sight. They were made to handle capital ships...not one on one fighter skirmishes. The first of the bombers was rocked by a dual laser blast, as Raul had linked his cannons for the assault. He grinned as it tore the wing off the bomber, leaving the fighter with little to no hope of doing a thing, save for explode. He didn't wait for it, as his cannons were quickly moved to the second fighter...fighting to get clean tone...</i>

<i>A couple of fleet command staff officers together with  several communications and opprations officers were sitting or standing in the opperations center on the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar.
<br>A huge holographic image with the tactical map of the entire battlescene was filling the room. Some officers were standing within the holographic image discussion to each other or giving orders or questions to other officers that who were standing at com consoles that were placed in a ring around the holographical display. The holoprojectors had been added to the ceeling so the officers marching through the image didn't erease too much of the picture.
<br>An officer that was standing near to Grand Admiral Simon was using a stick to draw an imaginary circle around the holoprojection of the icon of the starfortress. Sensors identified the movement of the stick and the computer displayed the stats of the fortress close to the icon and readable from the officers location.</i>
<br>
<br>"You see, sir, the bomber are taking longe then expected to weaken the shields of the fortress." The officer told Michael.
<br>
<br>"I guess we have to buy our bombers some more time. Currently we have a light advance against the Remnant forces, and as soon as our squadrons win the superiority against their outdated TIE Fighters, we could take them out ship by ship. But in the last time Horus was ever one step ahead of us, leading to two alternatives.
<br>One Horus don't cares for the personnel and equipment here, he just keeps them in battle here to keep us busy, so he can do something somehwere where he don't like to see us, or he planned to win this battle, and I guess we have to expect some surprices in case that was his plan."
<br>
<br><i>Michael was turning around and making to steps to get closer to the map region where the two fleets were placed.</i>
<br>
<br>"Nevertheless, we need to take out the Interdictor, to be able to remove our forces from here in case it gets nessesary.. The three ISDs and two VSDs covering the Interdictor pretty stong in a kind of arrow formation. We can't send bomber squadronsthrough the alley between the stardestroyers. I guess our ships don't survive tto long within the close combat range of several stardestroyers at once. We need to attack the Interdictor from the blind point of the formation, from behind.
<br>We'll take the bomber squadrons from the Hamburg and the Immortal give them all fighters we have around and we can give them as escorst and send them on a route to the fortress. On the half of the way they should turn around and launch an attack on the Interdictor from the rear side of the formation. We just have one run till they strengthen their denfese at that point, so at least the generators for the gravitation wave should be taken out."
<br>
<br>The officer was saluting quickly "Will transmit that to the Hamburg and the Immortal."
<br>
<br><i>While the officer was leaving another officer that had stand together with some communications officers before was walking to the Grand Admiral.</i>
<br>
<br>"Admiral, we got several reports from the other carriers. Their squadrons that attack the station seem to be able to deal with the TIE Fighters but they report about problems with the laser turrets."
<br>
<br>"Well, .. I guess we need to put the defences of the fortress higher, on the target list. As soons as the shields are down the bombers should concentrate their fire on the weapon systems. Maybe their escorts can help them on that. But the bombers should keep some ammunition for the other targets."

<i>would watch the battle persue, seeing some of his fighters taking on those pesky bombers as he pondered, watching the V formation of the Sd's protecting the lone Interdictor</i>
<br>
<br>Looks like our bombers are starting to make some runs on that interdictor..hmm....Tactical, give me a display of probability  of the Warspite attempting a full throttle charge below the SD's and to side swiped the interdictor with torps....
<br>
<br>well sir, highly probable we'd sustain critcal damage from that type of manuever
<br>
<br>Aye...well...we are better at speed than hunking down, unlike our destroyer buddies...What are shields at helm?
<br>
<br>Sir, we are at 60% and still slolwy decreasing from the volleys of fire from those star destroyers
<br>
<br>Communications, send a coded message to the Zentar to ask all carriers to give maximum cover-fire for a ship to ship charge.  We're faster than alot of the ships in the 5th, and, I believe we can skinny under those destroyers and come up inbetween them and that interdictor, volleying off torpedoes and blasters at close range...something they'd have to deactiveate thethe wells to keep their shields

<i>Davor's first day aboard the Predator had been hectic. His second was proving to be outright hellish, as local space erupted into a pitched battle in which his squadron was taking part. As soon as he had suited up, he ran as fast as he could to the briefing room, but found it empty. Everyone else had scrambled when the first shots had been fired. He sighed heavily and ran toward the hangar, hoping that all of the action hadn't already taken place, and that he could, at the very least, participate in the cleanup.
<br>
<br>He strapped on his helmet and slid down into the pilot's seat before running his checkup and palming the switch to lower the canopy. Davor almost forgot to request clearance to leave as he throttled up and the A-Wing lurched forward towards the hangar's electromagnetic shielding. Exhilaration coursed through his veins. He nudged the pilot's yoke slightly to port and pulled it in towards his chest, pulling the A-Wing's nose up and finally orienting him towards the battle running its course.
<br>
<br>Space battles were a sight that would be beautiful were it not for their lethality, and this one was no exception. Massive explosions blossomed against the background of space as energized particles leapt between behemoth space vessels, creating an elaborate dance of death. His sensors blaring their indication of the presence of a nearby fighter, Davor threw his fighter into a corkscrew to evade its sensor locks. He leveled out again and thrust the yoke forward, pushing the fighter's nose down and bringing him toward the Predator once more...</i>

<br>
<br>"Commodore, BG 1 is redirecting their attacks on the Interdictor."
<br>
<br>"Hmm... I believe they found this taking more time than planned. Send new squadron orders, Crimson covers our bombers and Cobalt/Auric goes for space superiority. Tell our bombers to fire at will and prepare the hangar for a quick bomber reload."
<br>
<br>"Sir, Davon Jurist has exited the hangar. I don't believe he has been in the fight earlier."
<br>
<br>"Damnit, alright, just tell him to find his squadron and stick to it. I'll deal with him later."
<br>
<br><i>Tax waited for a ship report</i>
<br>
<br>"Shields at 80%, we're not taking much damage."
<br>
<br>"Alright, give engine some power and take us closer to the stardestroyers, put us on broadside, redirect shields to starboard side."

<i>Raul had felt the disturbance, and had planned a defensive manuever when he had felt the nudge from Gene's mind probing that of the fighter's behind him. He smirked a little, but sent a beep of thanks to Gene as his fighter continued to keep the bombers on the run...he knew the Warspite was doing something very dangerous, and highly unorthodox...and it just might win the fight...or at least make it easier. His flight path was one that zigged and zagged through the volleying turbolasers. He had heard over the comlink about the order concerning Lucius, and he shrugged slightly...the man had orders, and if he wasn't gonna follow them...it was his career at stake.</i>

<br><i>Another officer was running towards Michael:</i>
<br>
<br>"Sir, the enemy lost more then 50 percent of his bombers and fighters, the remaining fighters seem unorganized. The shields of the fortress are taking longer then expected. It looks like a high number of stormtrooper transportes and escort shuttles started from the stardestroyers towars the Warspite and some smaller ships. Wer are not sure if they want to attack or board the ships. Increase the attack on the remaining opponent fighters or on the stromtrooper transports?"
<br>
<br>"Neither, we'll need every ship that is small and fast enough to outmaneuver the defences of the fortress to take shields and weapon systems of the station down. The gunships and corellian corvettes that are escorting the Hamburg and the Immortal should move to the Warspite and increasse the defense there against the stormtrooper transporters. We can also move additional soldiers to the warspite with plain shuttles if nessesary. The bombers and fighters of Hamburg and Immortal should launsh attacks on the fortress to, and send our escort shuttles and transports with them."

<br>"Ok, open a channel to the fleet, commander."
<br>
<br>"Aye, sir."
<br>
<br>"This is Admiral Simon. To the 5th fleet. Looks like Horus has sent two terrors to intercept us. They already sent bomber squadrons to attack us. But before we leave the sector we are breaking through Horus old fleet and try to take some of them out. Horus ships lost their fighter escort and the smaller escort ships and we have some bombers left and a superiority of battleships. As soon as we are broken through the stardestroyer formation we'll leave into hyperspace. We need some voluteers of our best squadrons to intercept the bombers to give us a bit more time. They are surely escorted by TIE Phantoms, so we need just the best pilots in 100% opperational fighter out there. Every ships that passed the imperial formation will not see behind and directly enter into hyperspace. ANd the remaining fighters and bomber will return into hyperspace as soon as the fleet is away or not operational anymore. Good luck everyone, may the force be with you and see you on the other side."
<br>
<br><i>I didn't took long till the battleships was in close combat with the remaining ISDs and VSDs of the remnant fleet. The laser batteries of the Angel of Death were already shooting holes into the hull of an opposing ISD while this ship was still triing to take out the shields of the Angel. Corvettes transports and a few remaining fighters and bombers were supporting the battleships in the final assault, but the bombers had passed almost half of their way, and the terrors were surely comming closer too.</i>

He checked his status with his R-unit...no dice. The R-unit had taken a hit in the blaster fire. So, on his own again, Raul evened out his shields, swinging in a slow, lazy arc, trying to let the Phantom think he was damaged much worse than he was...which worked. The Phantom followed him, thinking to get an easy kill, when suddenly, his afterburners hit, and he jumped out in front of the Phantom, and swung his ship around in a tight turn...one that couldn't be done by a human pilot in a gravity field...due to the G forces involved. As soon as he faced the TIE, his quad cannons unleashed hell in space...and he hit the TIE on the stabilizer, which sent the Phantom into a spin, out of control. Raul swept his X-wing back around, and finished off the TIE...breathing a sigh of relief. However, he was now on his own in space...no way to repair his ship. He knew it was going to be close.</i>

Lucius' ship dropped, and twisted in space ending up under the bomber. The enemy ship could not turn as fast as Lucius' A-Wing. Using the advantage, Lucius ended up behind the bomber and fired a few missiles.</i>
<br>
<br><i>As he was ready to finish it off one of the phantoms shot a missile at the A-Wing. The shields were 50% down.</i> "Damn it"

<i>would manuever the E-Wing about as he watched, there were just too many phantoms starting to come in with bombers from that reinforcement fleet, looking back, he'd watch the capitol ships desperately pouring it all to reach a clearance area to launch, 2 phantoms coming up on his six as he began to hit full power</i>

<i>Raul could sense the frustration coming from his mentor, the Corellian spinning his X-wing through the debris and the space towards him. His X-wing seemed to come to life, as if feeling rather happy with the situation. He knew the rookie would follow him, because that was his assignment. His quad cannons came to life as he came up behind Gene's tails', clipping one with a blast, and firing his remaining torpedo at another. The Phantoms scrambled to get away, giving Raul a little bit of satisfaction. He knew, however, he shouldn't remain too smug yet. He was by far the most damaged ship out here...but, he knew he had a duty to do.</i>

<i>The capital ships of the 5th fleet were fliing away from the remnants of of three stardestroyers. The other two had managed to escape into hyperspace.</i>
<br>
<br>"Looks like we are done here." High Admiral Horn mentioned on the bridge "How far are the bomber away."
<br>
<br>"They should be in range each second." a commander answered.
<br>
<br>"Ok, signal the fleet to leave this place."

<br>
<br>Alright, X-Wings, hold back till the A-Wings have jumped with the Predator, then we'll jump when the Warspite has, new priotority is watching their sixes, stay frosty out there
<br>
<br>Warspite, signal when jumping and we'll be following you, prepare all hangar decks to receive crippled and alert medical and fire teams to standby on call, Ice out.

<i>Tax also got the message of the tactical retreat to commence.</i>
<br>
<br>"Alright people, stabilize your shields and get the hell out of here. Make sure you outrun the phantoms and watch for enemy missiles."
<br>
<br><i>Tax also heard Gene's reply</i>
<br>
<br>"Don't worry about us Gene, I think we can push these fighters upto 140gmlt, you worry about getting the slower X-Wings out of here."
<br>
<br><i>Tax redirected his shieldpower to engines and hit the accelerator. 135gmlt.</i>
<br>
<br>"Predator, go for hyperspace when ready and prepare for emergency landing when arriving at the rendevouz point."
<br>
<br><i>Tax allowed the A-Wings to continue, himself turning around, joining up with his speeding X-Wing squadron.</i>

<br>"Double check your hyperspace engines and follow me. Full speed, everything you've got."

"Team, pull back, dont get killed on your way back home" <i>Lucius messaged his fly team.</i>
<br>
<br><i>As he turned around with a swift movement he saw a few phantoms follow.</i>
<br>
<br>"Touch chance" <i>he smirked and put the throttle full speed.</i> "The A-Wings are out of here"

<i>Raul grinned to himself as he watched the fleet begin the jump, having to manually input the hyperspace co-ordinates. It took him a few moments to do so, knowing the Phantoms would be wanting to get the last few stragglers they could. Touch and go, and he knew it. But by the time the Predator had jumped, he would have finished the task. He kept up, somewhat, with the other X-wings, baiting a few Phantoms into following...only to find themselves in some trouble of their own as they came up on the Warspite. The remaining Phantoms decided to fight another day, and backed off, as Raul grinned once more. Ready and able to jump with the others, he just needed the signal to throw the throttle, and hit the route.</i>

<i>The A-Wings had reached the hyperspace point. With a simple nudge on a button they all entered Hyperspace. Tax and Lucius were the only ones behind of the A-Wings.</i>
<br>
<br>"Lucius, jump to hyperspace, I'll see you on the Predator soon. Now go, that's an order!"
<br>
<br>"X-Wings, report in."
<br>
<br>"Graham here, all X-Wings will enter hyperspace in 30 seconds. The Phantoms are retreating."
<br>
<br><i>The Predator was seen leaving the battle shortly followed by it's X-Wing squadrons.</i>
<br>
<br>"Starwind, get the hell out of here, we're the only ones left. What's your status?"

<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
"Hope you know what you are doing Tax....See you on the other side"
<br>
<br><i>Lucius got into the hyperspace</i> "finally" <i>he sighed with relief, although he still was worried about his Commander.</i>
