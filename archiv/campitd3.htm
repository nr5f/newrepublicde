<h1>Into the Darkness Part III: The Endless Nothing</h1>

<p class="text">
Everything was much darker here, outside of the galaxy. An interesting experiance in the eyes of High Admiral Darth Angelus. The SSD Angel of Darkness had just left the dancing lights of hyperspace into this dark place. Behind them the spiral of the galaxy, not completely visible, they were still too close, and ahead of them the red sun of Trearian Exterrior. Two planets were rotating around the star. A gas giant defending the system from all smaller particles drifting through this regions of space and a small world out of an obsidean like rock, and this world was calling for him.
Angelus noticed that some of the others on his bridge was listening to the world as well.
<br><br>"Sir, the carriergroups Predator and Payback left hyperspace." one of the Communication officers directed to the High Admiral.
<br><br>"Long range radar signatures?" Angelus asked one of the other bridge officers.
<br><br>"Positive sir, we have 3 SSD shaped objects and maybe a dozend smaller ones orbiting the 1st planet of the system."
<br><br>"Ok, signal the other carriergroups, we proceed to the planet, ready to attack."
<br><br>"Sir shouldn't we wait for the other battlegroups? I mean we may be slightly outnumbered."
<br><br>"Since we have seen them, they probably have seen us. We cannot avoid the battle so I would prefer to have at least the first shot."
<br><br><br>A bit later on the bridge of the SSD Angel of Darkness. High Admiral Angelus was watching the enemy fleet in from of the Angel pretty emotionless.
<br><br>"Sir, the opponent is starting his bombers. Sould we start fighter squadrons to encounter them?" One of the bridge officers asked.
<br><br>"In a few moments. Proceed with the 4th maneuver we trained before the campaign first. Use our mines and everything else that explodes to clean the attack range around our hangar exits first."
<br><br>"Aye, sir."
<br><br>The battleships of Battlegroup hunter used everything they had to change the regions around their hangar exits into dead zones. The darkness of space seemed to explode everywhere and waves of laser bolts were cutting though the clouds of fire. A few wrecks parts TIE Phantoms were soon drifting in the area, while intact TIE Phantoms lost their stealth devices and the turbo laser batteries of the big ships were following their trails.
<br><br>On the bridge the High Admiral was singnaling his officers to start the squadrons now.
<br><br>"Ok, go go go." The comm officers were shouting through the comm channels.
<br><br>And the first wave of fighter squadron started to launsh from the battleships of the battlegroup. 
</p>

<p class="text">  
"Alright! Lets take some 'Ghosts' down!!" Following Auric Lead, the twelve X-Wings fly in a dagger head formation. After getting away from VSND Predator, Aurics split apart and fly in their own separate flight groups each taking on groups of TIE Phantoms.
<br><br>"Flight Group Three, watch yourself, a majority of these 'Ghosts' seem to have lost their ability to cloak but we don't know how many have their cloak still active. Keep your eyes open." The three X-Wings of flight group three spread apart and take their targets. Each pilot blasts away at least two Phantoms before rejoining the rest of the squadron to repeat the process.
</p>

<p class="text">
"Admiral," one of the bridge officers reported to High Admiral Angelus: "We are dealing with the TIE Phantoms far better then expected. We have reports of 2 maybe 3 of their squadrons down without a single loss on our side at the moment. Looks like we catched them unaware, sir."
<br><br>"Well, excellent." the admiral replied: "The started launching their regular fighters and bombers, but maybe we can get the first strike. Give orders to deploy 2 B-Wing squadrons. Auric and the Daggers did well out they, they should move into escort position. Maybe we can make some bomb run on that leading ISD of the formation."
<br><br>"ISD Tribunal, sir."
<br><br>"Exactly. They should hurry. Maybe we can catch our opponent a second time unaware." 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<p class="text"> 
The Aurics form back up on 1-1, "Orders have changed boys. New orders from the Grand Admiral are to cover the B-Wings as they make their attack run on that Imp. Star. Your goal is to not let a single B-Wing be TOUCHED! You understand?"
<br><br>Everyone gives a large, "Yes, sir!" and the comm channels go back to flight group specific. "Auric Threes, we're gonna handle Green squad while Dagger covers Gold. We'll make sure every proton torpedo is accounted for in the hull of the Imp Star."
<br><br>The twelve X-Wings form a circle around the B-Wing squadron, taking out TIE Fighters that get too close to the formation. The B-Wings are in a safe small circle, once the bombers get within targeting range, Auric Ones break off and allow the B-Wings to drop their loads.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commander James Ory</p>

<p class="text">
Half a dozend of intact TIE Phantoms targeted the 4 squadrons apraoching the ISD Tribunal. In the initial attack two from the Daggers got damaged and they took down one of the Aurics. Commander Ory barely dodged the first suprise attack of one of them.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<p class="text">
"We lost Auric 2-3!"
<br><br>"Grah! Damn!" The green bursts of superheated gas scratch against James' deflector shields. "Watch it Flight Group Three! Let's break off and tag those 'Ghosts!'" The three X-Wings break away from formation as the remainder of Auric stay behind for covering fire. "Stay aware Aurics!" Commander Ory then switches signals over to the command frequency.
<br><br>"Admiral? Are there any more squadrons coming out for support or are we on our own out here?! Please respond!" Awaiting the response, James banks away from a trailing Phantom as Auric 3-3 blows it away.
</p>

Rear Admiral Thes Nazud and Vice Admiral Mattias Gustafsson were standing on the bridge of the VNSD Predator watching the slow progress of their Battlegroup.
<br><br>"Sir, we got a call from Auric squadron, they got ambushed by Phantoms and request immeadiate reinforcements." one of the comm officers reported.
<br><br>"Cobalt is our closest squadron." Tax said, pointing on the strategical map: "But still pretty far away."
<br><br>"Aye." Thes replied: "The only ones close enough to Auric are the 1st two flightgroups of Darkstar squadron."
<br><br>"I'll contact High Admiral Sifi for reinforcing Auric."
<br><br><br>Meanwhile in the cockpits of Darkstar squadron.
<br><br>"Darkstar, this is Vice Admiral Pat. We are transmitting new mission objectives to your nav computers. You need to help Auric Squadron immediately. No time to waite, get there and help them against those TIE Phantoms."
<br><br><br>"Go Auric," Rear Admiral Ash Halcyon, the commander of Darkstar squadron yelled into the fleet communication channel. "We take care of the ghosts. Go and take down the stardestroyer."
<br><br><br>Meanwhile on the bridge of the Angel of Darkness:
<br><br>"Sir, we have around 200 bombers incomming, shouldn't more our fighters into an intercepting position."
<br><br>"No, we wait, commander." High Admiral Darth Angelus replied: "The hyperspace buoy have been placed, we just have to wait."
<br><br><br>Auric squadron and the Daggers from the Angel had brought almost all B-Wings to their asigned target, just one minute were remaining till the bombers would reach the weapons range of the ISD Tribunal.
<br><br>"Concentrate on your target." Rear Admiral Thes Nazud broudcasted to the squadron.
<br><br>"Avengers incomming, 11 o'clock." One of the B-Wing pilots shouted into the microphone.
<br><br><br>A few hundret metres behind Auric. Nearly 15 squadrons of TIE Bombers and TIE Assault Bombers procedded to the Angel, just a few minutes till they were in range. Several TIE Fighters and TIE Interceptors were defeding them, even two flight groups with TIE Defenders were there.
<br><br>The pilot of Iota 10 from the ISD Stronghold was preparing for the torpedo run double checking everything again. Within milliseconds the giant hull of a Calamari Cruiser appeared in front of them leaving hyperspace. He managed to turn around his TIE Bomber, but his two wingmen collided with the hull of the Republican warship.
<br><br>4 Republican capitol ships and more then a dozend of fighters had left hyperspace fireing all their guns on the surprized opponent squadrons on the way to the SSD Angel of Darkness.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<p class="text">
"Damn. Aurics! Lets take care of those TIE Avengers!" The X-Wings split off to assault the incoming attackers. It seems perfect how each X-Wing got his own Avenger to tangle with. "Where are those reinforcements? I thought they were sending some."
<br><br>After his thought was complete, his status window read that multiple Republic cruisers have blinked into the system. "Not what I was thinking...but it'll do." As he says this, Commander Ory guns down an Avenger and moves off to attack a TIE going after one of the B-Wings.
</p>

<p class="text">
"Auric Squadron,y'all need hand.."Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler third Wing Commander from ASD Prometheus yelled into the fleet communication channel not long after his TIE Interceptor came out of hyperspace Roughneck Squadron a X-wing squadron. "Because its my way of helping my former squadron that I once command...Kappa,Lambda,Mu,Nu,Omega and Roughneck Squadron who has joined my flight lead for this battle..Lets help out Auric Squadron and Battlegroup Hunter Fighter squadron in taking down TIEs,now."
<br><br>"Aye, sir."
<br><br>Rear Admiral Skywaler after giving out his order guns down an Avenger that was on Auric Lead tail.Then he banks to his left because he saw Commander Ory's X-Wing fly pass with a TIE Interceptor on his tail.
<br><br>"Commander Ory,watch it you have one on your tail..I'm on my way." he shouted into his helmets microphone as he pulls back hard on his fight joystick to do 160 degree turn so he can save fellow New Republic pilot and friends.

<p class="text">
"Looks like our forces are almost equal to Horus' fleet now Horus lost his bomber wave." Vice Admiral Wolverine discussed with Grand Admiral Michael Simon on the bridge of the Prometheus.
<br><br>"The war went out worse for Horus then I expected, if this is the rest of the forces surrounding him. Well, time to win this battle, we should fall back into the left flank position of Worf's Battlegroup, Commy should take the right flank. Worf has the biggest ship, he can take the lead, for now.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<p class="text">
"Man! Hotshot I owe you two now! Somebody's getting drunk after this tour!" James barrel rolls away from the explosion and the rest of Auric forms up on the B-Wings. Closing in on the Star Destroyer the X-Wings and B-Wings pummel the shields and hull with a barrage of Proton Torpedoes.
<br><br>Pulling a 180, Auric and the B-Wings spin away from the exploding Destroyer. "Whoo-hoo! You guys have any more room on the side of your fighters? Don't think we can fit a Star Destroyer there!" The rest of his squadron laughs but then silenced after a harsh warning from command about, "Comm Chatter." Commander Ory closes his comm channel and smiles a bit, "Finally, the Remnant is going down today."
</p>

<p class="text">
Michael was watching the explosion of the ISD Tribunal through the bridge windows of the ASD Prometheus. The 5th fleet was slowly comming closer to the fleet of warlord Horus, while the other fleet was moving into formation. It was different back then ...
<br><br><br><i>On the bridge of a different ship, the Eclipse Class Superstardestroyer Dominant, 5 years in the past. Michael was looking through the window of the bridge seeing a huge star fortress in front of them. It was the strongest point of the perimeter Grand Admiral Horus used to defend his territories. Horus had 20 stardestroyers defending the station, but Michael had almost 50 stardestroyers following them. Several other fleets were coordinated in the attack as well. Grand Admiral Michael Simon and Grand Admiral Frank Andries were standing on the bridge of the Dominant expecting the following battles.
<br><br>"Sir, we are in position, mean weapon is ready." Commodore Don Aino, the commander of the Dominant reportet.
<br><br>"Fire." Michael replied.
<br><br>Nothing happened.
<br><br>"Not the best moment for a mailfunction of the main weapon."
<br><br>There was some noise in the rear sections of the bridge, he was about to turn around when a laser bolt sparely wounded his arm. Behind Michael three bridge officers were taking down the attacker while Michael was going to ground. He directly stood up again.
<br><br>"Sir, the responsibles for the main weapon aren't repliing." Commodore Aino reported. He had tried to find out the problem when the main weapon wasn't fireing.
<br><br>"Sir, we lost contacts to the engine room as well."
<br><br>Michael was turning to Frank: "Frank I want the ship back. Take everyone you trust and get the control of the weapons and the engines back."
<br><br>"No problem, Mike, will do."</i>
<br><br><br>Vice Admiral Wolverine was communication Rear Admiral Mike Skywalker: "Mike, coordinate your wing with the other two wings. Start your assaults on the enemy ships as soon as all the bombers are out."
<br><br>At the same time Rear Admiral Thes Nazud was contacting Auric squadron: "Auric, bring the bombers back home for reloading." 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<p class="text">
High Admiral Matt looked down at a tactical monitor.
<br><br>"Ash and Buran, take your squadrons and cover Auric while they reload. Don't let the TIEs pick any of those birds off," Matt said into the commlink.
<br><br>Matt wiped some blood from his forehead. He had bumped it on a particularly sharp edge of a console while the Payback was under fire. He examined the blood-stained rag for a moment, and stuffed it partially back into his pocket.
<br><br>"Once Auric is set, rejoin the fray with them. No casualties!" 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">High Admiral Matt Sifi</p>

<p class="text">
Battlegroup Hunter was meanwhile on a line with Battlegroups One and Zentar. The Republican and the Imperial fleet were opposing each other in a wide formation now.
<br><br>"Surprizingly Horus isn't retreating." Michael said.
<br><br>"Why should he, he has more ships then we have." Wolverine replied.
<br><br>"Correct, but not enough to clearly dominate the battle. I doubt Horus has as large backups as the Republic. Let's see what Horus has planned here."
<br><br><br><i>5 years earlier, the battle had taken a few hours. Nearly one third of the Michael's fleet had turned sides and was hunting along with warlord Horus' forces the remaining ships on Michael's sides. The planned clear victory had become a desaster. Michael wasn't aware at this time that the fleet of HIgh Admiral Jjerrows had turned against him as well.
<br><br>A group of 4 former 5th fleet stardestroyers were fliing along the left side of the Dominant, penetrating the defenseless hull of the superstardestroyer with their laser batteries.
<br><br>Michael and the few remaing loyal staff officers had tried to manage the chaos in the last hour, but the decisions were set. The orders were set, the battle decided. Michael was starring into the darkness, seeing the wrecks of the stardestroyers in front of the Dominant symbolising the ruins of his plans. He was slowly realising his fate had just changed.
<br><br>"The ship evacuated?" he asked Don.
<br><br>"Yes admiral, everyone not nessesary is out."
<br><br>"OK, you can order the complete evacuation in a moment."
<br><br>Michael was tuning to one of the communicators: "Frank, you have the reactor controls back."
<br><br>"Yes, but we wont get the reactor back online. The traitors have sabotaged the reactor before we won the controls back."
<br><br>"Ok, Colonel Tronks, can you get the main weapon working with the reserve engery."
<br><br>"Just with 60 percent effective damage."
<br><br>"We are not fireing on a planet, 60 percent are enough."
<br><br>"But it will drain almost all energy of the ship."
<br><br>"Our engines are down, this is the last battle of the Dominant."
<br><br>Minutes later the rest of the personnel of the Dominant had been evacuated to the ISD Hamburg XII which got escorted by the Ratio. The last shot of the Dominant had taken out Horus' starfortress.</i>

<p class="text">
"Man! Hotshot I owe you two now! Somebody's getting drunk after this tour!"
<br>Admiral Skywaler heard from Commander Ory on the Fleet frequincey.
<br><br>"Your not going to owe me nothing..The only thing I'm asking is keep your butt alive I don't want to lose another Friend and comrade." Mike replied back as he did a 180 degree turn into a barrel roll to dodge some from the explosion of his Tie Fighters. Damn it Mike thought as he felt the lost when he heard Wolverine's order. Which he didn't have to reply because he was already forming up his wing to start their attack runs the enemy ships. While Mike's Fighter Wing head to the formation of Warlord Horus ships, the wing commander picked up two eyeballs on his tail.
<br><br>"Frak,Little help here..I have to eyes on my tail." 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</p>

<p class="text">
Hearing the distress call, James breaks off of formation asking his squadmates to look after the B-Wings and fill in his hole. The X-Wing banks towards Mike's fighter and the two TIE Fighters. "Maybe you're right! I might not have to owe you anything!" Smiling, James pummels the two fighters with a hellstorm of crimson.
<br><br>"You ok there Hotshot?" Commander Ory asks as he goes back to defending the B-Wings. 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commander James Ory</p>

<p class="text">
"Thanks for the save pal. I thought I was a goner and would have been one with the force." Mike replied as he rejoined what’s left of his Wing as they start their attack runs on two Deuce ships.
<br><br>"Admiral Wolverine or Grand Admiral Simon what’s our latest tactical information." Rear Admiral Skywaler asked as blasted a Tie fighter to space dust that was on his pilot from Mu Squadron. Blast it, I need to know what’s going on. I’m losing my pilots left to right. Mike thought has he felt two more lives from his fighter wing. Focus Mike focus if you don't your going to Die in this battle today and you don't want that happening today Mike brought his Tie Interceptor in the right angle and let lose two proton torpedoes into the shield dome of one Deuce. 
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</p>

<p class="text">
The fleets started to move closer to their opponents, the long range weapons of both fleets started fireing already on their opponents.
<br><br><br>Vice Admiral Wolverine was triing to establish a secured radio connection with Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler while half a dozend of his staff members were triing to organize some of the squadrons.
<br><br>"Admiral Skywaler, the plan has been changed. The Prometheus is soon in range of that SSD over there, the SSD Habicht. I'm currently asigning the Bombers of Gamma and Eta Squadron to your wing as well as the Bomber squadrons from the Hamburg, Delta and Epsilon squadron. I will also sent you the Avengers from Iota squadron as support.
<br><br>You have 5 bomber squadrons then, break through the fighter defence of the SSD Habicht and take down. Any turbo laser turret and torpedo launsher that is aiming on the Prometheus, and if possible the shield generators as well."
<br><br><br>Meanwhile on the Predator. Rear Admiral Thes Nazud seen the holo images of the High Admirals Darth Angelus and Matt Sifi.
<br><br>"... ok, so Matt, Thes we are soon diving into the cloud of ISDs over there, we need to move into a closer formation." the holoprojection of Darth Angelus said.
<br><br>"We don't get our bombers through their fighter defenses again, they have meanwhile 3 to 4 times the fighters there, Avengers, Defenders, maybe even Phantoms. We need to wait with the bomber attack till we can coordinate it with the attack of the capitol ships."
<br><br>The main hangar of the Predator was shaking by warheads hitting the hull of the Venator Class Stardestroyer. Some mechanics were taking a look on Commander Ory's fighter while a group of other soldiers were loading fresh missles into it.
<br><br>"How long." James asked the hangar manager.
<br><br>"Just a few seconds."
<br><br><br>High Admiral Corran Skywalker was standing on the bridge of the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar, watching a a giant SSD slowly moving into weapos range.
<br><br><br><i>3 years ago.
<br><br>"A pretty huge wreck," Vice Admiral Jedi3 said to High Admiral Corran Skywalker the acting Fleet Commander of the 5th fleet, both standing on the bridge of the Zentar. "I'm wondering how Simon got this down."
<br><br>Battlegroup Zentar was waiting in front of a field of destroyed stardestroyers, in the middle of the field was the burned out remnant of a Superstardestroyer. Battlegroups Zentar and Hunter had both been ordered to this sector to gain control again cause the Imperial Remnant had drastically increased the activity in this sector before.
<br>Grand Admiral Simon had disappeared with Battlegroup One, the defense fleets of Delasol and a couple of other former Imperial units, and here they found them again. It looked like the Grand Admiral was fighting with a special fraction of the Remnants all over the sector.
<br><br>This was making Corran's mission easier to deal with the Remnants in the sector, but he didn't like the idea of cleaning the mess up here.</i>
<br><br><br>Red laser bolts were touching the front of the Prometheus ending in small blue lights on the hull.
<br><br>Michael was watching the scene from the bridge. The stardestroyer class the Prometheus belonged to was developed two decades after the the of the opponent ship, the Superstardestroyer. Even when the development progress was rushed forward in the last years of the empire and the production of the Prometheus had begun 2 years before the scheduled end of the development phase, this ship was able to deal with some hits of its larger opponent.
<br><br>"Is Skywaler ready?" Michael asked Wolverine.
<br><br>"He is putting everything together, a matter of seconds, maybe he has his group organized while we are speaking."
<br><br><br><i>On the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar the captain was remembering his earlier confrontations with warlord Horus.
<br><br>2 years ago in the Helmsduster system. The 5th fleet was attacking the Horus' base of operations in the sector. A giant starfortress.
<br><br>Raul Jaknae was piloting his X-Wing over the surface of this giant space-structure. The size of the station was filling all the windows of his cockpit. Dozends of Laser turrents mounted on the hull of the station where trying to shot him down. The fire works were impressive.
<br><br>Maybe they had accomplished their largest victory against Horus on that date. The first time Horus was forced to hold the progress and restructure his forces, and the beginning of the end of Horus' domain.</i>

Damn it Mike thought as he flet another lost not long after watching the New Republic Fighter explode. Mike justed order the remainding fighters from his fighter wing from ASD Prometheus regroup on his six not long after he recived the orders form the Admiral Wolverine.Soon after looking at his HUD seeing that he lost Lambda, Omega , and half of Mu Squadron. These Imps are going to pay for killing my men and women that have died today Skywaler thought as he heard one of his remaind squadron leaders reporting in that bombers squadron Gamma,Eta,Delta, and Epsilon squadron a mixed wing of bombers form Prometheus and Hamburg.
Then comes along the Iota 's Avenger Squadron from Fighter Wing two on Prometheus as support.Great it can't get worst than it already is The Wing Commander thought as he active his command frequincey.
<br><br>"Admiral Skywaler to the Prometheus, we starting our attack run on the SSD Habicht."Mike reported before closing the channel and switchin over to the Fighter Wing frequincey.
<br><br>"Ok,boys listen up...Kappa,Nu,and Iota Squadron you guys take out the fighter screen from the Habicht..That will wiating for us and pick off our bombers..So that means protect them at all cost...Mu,Gamma,Eta,Delta, and Epsilon squadron start your attack runs on the turbo laser turret and torpedo launsher that is aiming on the Prometheus, and if possible the shield generators as well...We're going to blast that sorry bastarder sky high..My the force be with you..I'll buy drinks for everyone after this mission is over." Mike said in a clear, stern and commanding voice as he piloted his fighter into the hot zone near SSD Habicht.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</p>

<p class="text">
"Ok enough resting." the voice of Vice Admiral Pat left the speakers of the hangar on the Payback: "We have a business to do out there."
<br><br>Soon later the hangar started to shake when the ship got hit by a wave or warheads.
<br><br><br>The Prometheus was meanwhile close to the Habicht and reigns of laser bolts from the opponent ship were hitting both ships. Through the window of the bridge Vice Admiral Wolverine was able to see a number of torpedo impacts on the hull of the Habicht.
<br><br><br>Michael was standing on a terminal on the left side of the bridge when an officer was doing orbital scans of the planet below.
<br><br>"We have found a landing field on the planet with a dozend of shuttles and tranports." The officer reported.
<br><br>"May get important soon." Michael replied.

"You're good to go!" The mechanic slams his hand twice against the hull of James' X-Wing. Along with the rest of his squadron, they burst out of the Predator's hanger bay.
<br><br>"Alright Aurics, first we were assigned a babysitting job. Now it's time to show the Remnant what we really got! Defend our home and our friends! Take no prisoners!"
<br><br>Smirking at the speech Auric Leader made, James breaks off from formation into a separate flight group along with the rest of the squadron. Each flight group took a group of Fighters and Bombers. "Alright Auric Threes, our job is to hunt down and destroy as many TIEs that serve as a threat to the main cruisers. We do this until we get new orders from Command. Understood?!" A unanimous, "Yes, sir!" is heard over the private comm channel James hooked up.
<br><br>"These are all good pilots...and I plan to keep them alive to have their kids be the same." Commander Ory thinks to himself before engaging a TIE Interceptor.

High Admiral Matt Sifi was looking through the bridge window seeing his squadron forming up around the CRS Payback.
<br><br><i>Back then, one year ago, they had finally stopped getting kicked by warlord Horus in the Outer Rim. On Featippa they had their first assaults against the territories of the Imperial warlord. While the fleet was spread over the nearby systems, trying to take out several opponent targets their task was an support platform of warlord Horus.
<br><br>Their attack did even surprise the those Imperial Remnant admirals who had usually planned everything. An entire convoi with military equipment was there, transporting important supplies for the frontlines of warlord Horus armadas.
<br><br>At the end of the day the platform in the system and their defenders had been fallen and the Republic was victorious.
<br><br>The other battlegroups had completed a couple of tasks that day as well. Sure none of these targets were that important, but the impacts this attacks had. Horus had been too greedy in the years before, conquered too much territories, in a too short time. Not enough time to strengthen the support lines for his forces all over that territories. Horus was force to move units, withdraw them from several positions, consolidating them again. Horus was suddenly forced into defense and he didn't managed to recover from that.</i>
<br><br>"Matt all our fighters are out there." Vice Admiral Pat reported "And Thes reports they have their fighters out as well. I guess it's our turn now."
<br><br><br>Under some losses especially in Epsilon squadron of the ISD Hamburg XII Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler's attack group left hundrets of craters on the surface of the SSD. The SSD was fairly returning fire when the Prometheus sent out their waves of turbo lader rays against the giant ship. Would just be a matter of time.
<br><br>"Admiral, you're shuttle is ready." on of the officers reported to Michael "From the number transports locadeted on the surface of the planet there are not more then hundret persons over there, but not all transports may have remained on the surface so there may be more down there."
<br><br>"Well the risk is less then it appears, but we'll wait till we clearly dominated the battle here." Michael replied.
<br><br>Meanwhile Vice Admiral Wolverine was contacting Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler. "... so return your group to the hangars and get equipped with new warheads. We are moving behind the main fleet group of the Remnants and attacking them together with Battlegroup Hunter from two sides."

It was long after Mike kowledged Vice Admiral Wolverine new order and replyed the order to this fighter group,he was doing his best as he fought with his TIE interceptor controls as he dodge turbo laser turrets on the enemy Super Star Destroyer trying to losing his pursuers, the Admiral put everything he got to lost the Imp that was on his tail. But nothing work this enemy pilot was hot on his tail like predator going in for the kill on Dathomir.Blast it, why can’t I shack this guy Mike thought as he pulled back on the joystick towards him to bring his fighter out of the artificial canyons on the Super star destroyer.
Then he pushing the joystick to the left to bring his fighter into a sharp 180 degree turn to lose this pursuers, which it kind of worked because one fighter was taken out in a cross fire between the Prometheus and the Habicht.
His wing man easily avoided the lasers just like the admiral did but it was took late. The last remaining Enemy TIE fighter interceptor got a lock on Mike’s fighter and fired. With his quick thinking and the guidance from the force that for told what was going to happen next, Mike punched out and active his beckons.

"Looks like you have bridge." Grand Admiral Simon told to Vice Admiral Wolverine.
<br><br>"Aye."
<br><br>Michael used the elevator down to one of the hangars of the Prometheus, where 5 dozend officers and NCOs were waiting for Michael in front of of a few transporters. All of them veterans, 10, 20 or even 30 years in service. Soldiers that followed Michael into the Outer Rim a decade ago.
<br><br>"We are going down there admiral?" one of the higher ranked asked.
<br><br>"Soon, we have to win the battle in space first. We have to make sure that none of Horus' tricks will help him here. His rulership will end today."
<br><br><br>Battlegroup Zentar was meanwhile taking several hits from the Superstardestroyer opposing them. The CRS Warspite started shaking a bit. All ships of the battlegroup were returning fire with everything they had.
<br><br>On the bridge of the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar High Admiral Commskywalker and Vice Admiral Raul Jaknae were discussing the situation.
<br><br>"Our squadrons and those of the Warspite attacking this SSD?" the High Admiral asked.
<br><br>"They are still in dogfights with the fighter defense of the SSD, as soon as they get free they should be able to help us."
<br><br>Almost every ship Battlegroup Hunter was damaged, they had opposed the main group of warlord Horus force. Sure they had caused at least the same destruction to their opponent, but the fresher forces were pushing forward. Battlegroup Hunter just had to hold the position but the opponent was making this plan very difficult for High Admiral Darth Angelus and his Battlegroup.
<br><br>The Prometheus had meanwhile moved behind the main group of the opponent exchanging fire with the two ISDs holdig the rear position.
<br><br>Vice Admiral Wolverine was contacting Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler again: "... I guess we can handle those two ISDs. Take your attack group and clear the way for Battlegroup Hunter."
<br><br>Meanwhile in the hangar of the ASD Prometheus.
<br><br>"Ok, it's time." Michael told to the officers and soldiers waiting here: "We start in 2 minutes, everyone, get to your transport."

"... I guess we can handle those two ISDs. Take your attack group and clear the way for Battlegroup Hunter." Rear Admiral Skywaler heard over the command frequency not long after he was picked up from the cold dead space and he made his way over to the shuttles cockpit when he heard the orders. Which Mike just shook his head as he punch in the ASD Prometheus Fighter Group Three frequency to relay the orders, when he felt the shuttle shack violently.
The next minutes didn't go very well because the last thing Mike heard before blacking out was that the recovery shuttle was making a crash landing on the planet and the pilots were doing there best to keep the shuttle leveled,along with realying there last known position ot Prometheus. Before the shuttle made contact on the surface of the planet the last thoughts that ran through Mike's mind was hoping his Jedi Master Michael Simon and his old friend The Red Scrapper come and find him.

Off in the distance just a few clicks away from the battle a single fighter dropped out of hyperspace. A gleaming silver fighter with red markings. It was a combination of Mando'a and Republic markings signifying the pilot within. The fighter itself was a Bes'uliik class starfighter heavily modified and stripped for speed and power with minimal armor and shielding. Inside the craft the man with bright red hair covered by a Mando'a styled flight helmet adjusted his controls as he sent a signal to the Republic fleet. He smiled underneath his helmet as he said.
<br><br>”This is Ensign Leole Skirata call sign The Red Scrapper. I heard y'all was having a party and didn't invite me, now thats not very nice. Permission to join the attack on the enemy fleet? I'll join up with whoever needs me at the moment. Oh I almost forgot hows my old friend Admiral Skywaler he must be having a ball in this mess?”
<br><br>He chuckled as he punched the throttle and formed up with a fighter wings. He looked to his sides and smiled giving a thumbs up. He then faced forward and turned his mind to the battle ahead of him. He looked around and saw a number of enemies forming up on them. So he broke off and went straight for the enemy fights. He jerked his stick into a spun and shut off the stabilizers and shot every blaster he had on the fighter sending bolts all around him into a blossom of deadly energy. All the while he voice could be heard yelling.
<br><br>”Yaaaaaaa-hooooooooooo!! let get this dance started shall we. They don't call me The Red Scrapper for nothing. Come on get some boyos I got something for ya's.”
<br><br>He then turned on the stabilizers and jerked his stick again and leveled out. He then turned and saw the debris of several fighters he chuckled and kept his mind back to the fight. He weaved and dodged in and out of fighters. He spun every now and again to add flair to his flying but nothing overly fancy. His alarms blared notifying him of a missile lock. He looked and thought to himself. ”Blast they just don't quit do they?” He then he then cut his port engine with the starboard engine he jerked into a sharp turn.
He did this for a duration of point three two four seconds and then cut the port engine on again. He then shot forward to the fighter that locked on to him. He then punch the throttle and said aloud to himself.
<br><br>”Come on bantha poodoo. Let see of ya got the moxy to dance with me?”
<br><br>his fighter streak to the enemy fighter with frightening speed. He streaked past several Republic fighters slightly confusing them. The enemy fighter steeled himself playing Stephen's game. Stephen smiled as he dived straight down revealing the missiles behind him. The enemy fight tried to avoid but with only feet between him and the missiles he couldn't avoid in time. The missiles struck as he pulling up right underneath the cockpit. His fight blew in a bright configuration of light and debris. Stephen looked back and laughed as he turned back to the fight.

Squadrons of TIE Interceptors so thick they blocked out any light from the surrounding stars swarmed all over White Squadron. The mission objective relegated to the squadron sounded simple, break through any TIE defense and unload a cargo of missiles at the SSD. The briefing holocron had mentioned resistance would be medium to light.
<br><br>Straus cursed the wildly inaccurate briefing, all the while trying to outmaneuver the horde of Interceptors at his back. Under this kind of fire, the squadron would be lucky to make it back to the Zentar in one piece, let alone break through to get a shot at the SSD. The ultra agile X-Wing danced at Straus' maneuvering of the joystick, but the equally, if not more agile Interceptors matched his every move. It was only going to be a matter of time before the squadron could scratch one X-Wing and one ensign. Up ahead Commodore Aish was barley faring any better.
<br><br>"This is White 3-2, need assistance with these TIE's, over!"
<br><br>As soon as the request was over, the small cockpit of the X-Wing rumbled with anguish and several lights on the control board began to blink red. Glancing down, the systems diagnostic panel presented a technical diagram of the chassis. The right set of S-foils danced between red and black, indicating heavy damage. Peering out from the X-Wings canopy, Straus could see a trail of flame licking the black backdrop of space, emanating from both of the ships right foils. With the fighters maneuverability severely reduced, Straus was once again cursing the blasted briefing holocron.
<br><br>"This is light resistance?!"

Michael was sitting on the chair of the copilot while his lambda shuttle was entering the athmosphere of the black planet below them. A group of ATR-6 assault transport were following the shuttle. A group of more than a dozend Republican fighters from several different squadrons were defending the small convoi when they moved down to the planet.
<br><br>"Admiral, we have a radar signature from Admiral Skywaler's fighter. He went down somewhere near our position." the navigator of the shuttle reported.
<br><br>Michael opened a Republican channel on the com station: "ATR Omicron 3, looks like your getting an additional task, a search and rescue mission, well more like just a rescue mission. One of our fighters is down there, recover the pilot and proceed with your mission then."
<br><br>"Aye, sir." the comm replied.
<br><br>The ships proceeded few hundret meters lower in the thin athmosphere of the planet. Michael was able to identify a sort of temple structure close to their landing field where the transports of warlord Horus' fleet were already parked. The temple was made out of the same stone the entire planet was made of. It was easier to see now, cause some light were shining from there.
<br><br>The top of the temple was opening. Maybe the entrance of a hangar, Michael couldn't identify it. A steam of light was leaving the opening. A sort of wave was following seconds later. A few smaller objects like fighters and transports could resist the wave and stayed more or less close to the planet but the large battleships got pushed kilometers away.
<br><br>The pilot of Michael's shuttle couldn't hold the ship anymore. The entire formation was more or less unwillingly going down. The pilot was able to catch the shuttle again close above the surface and was able to land it in a small number of pieces pretty close to the position they originally determinated.

"Grand Admiral Simon, Flight Group Three of Auric Squadron has been requested to give air support while you and your men commence ground support. We'll assist with the search and rescue by being eyes in the sky. You got angels now." Smiling, Commander Ory takes his Flight Group and begins a search on the planet. A couple of TIE Fighters followed the trio of X-Wings but lucky for them TIEs were not very aerodynamic. The flat solar panels that doubled as wings helped them accelerate while flying in a straight line but cause the Fighter to slow to a crawl while turning. The advantage was to the X-Wings.
<br><br>"Fish in a barrel boys! Also, if you guys can attempt to find any sign of the pilot so the assault team can continue."
<br><br>A bright light stings Commander Ory's eyes and he glances over at the source. Seeing the massive light shooting out of the temple he witnesses the Republic capital ships being shoved away like Womprats in a sandstorm. "Sithspit! What the hell was that?!"

<p class="text">
The red flashes of light from the X-Wings HUD were suddenly joined by a cacophony of sirens. Pulling his gaze from the fighters right side engine ports, Straus faced forwards again, meeting the cold stare of the Super Star Destroyers cobalt hull. Even with a decrease in engine power, the X-Wing was making fast progress towards the warship. A precise weak spot in the structure of the Destroyer was White Squadrons goal. A full salvo of torpedoes to the area would by no means destroy the juggernaut, but it would certainly weaken it enough for further attack runs to make a noticeable, and hopefully fatal blow.
<br><br>However, the TIE fighters of Zeta squadron were making that possibility ever more slim as their relentless assault on the squadron continued. Volleys of laser fire had scathed almost every flight member, and Straus feared that any more time spent within the perimeter of the Destroyer would end with at least one fatality. The designated target area was still too far away to accurately hit, nestled amongst the Destroyers many artificial trenches. That said, with some skill, and a considerable amount of luck, the target was at the very least hittable.
<br><br>As Straus' Interceptor antagonist made a sharp turn for another attack pass on his failing X-Wing, he saw Commodore Aish's X-Wing launch it's torpedoes. Despite still being out of the optimal targeting zone, the Commodore had chosen to launch the attack, both to Straus' frustration and relief. Several azure trails streamed through the black veil of space separating White Squadron and the Destroyer as the other squadron members followed suit. The fighters of White Squadron collectively made a 180 degree turn and began to fly away from the Destroyer, whether their desperate attack was a success or a failure unknown to them.
<br><br>As White Squadron turned to face the battle still raging above the mysterious planet below however, a more pressing query passed from Straus' lips.
<br><br>"What in the name of the force is that?!"
<br><br>With the somewhat abrupt comment said, White Squadrons eyes turned towards the gigantic stream of golden light shooting up from the planets surface and deep into the recesses of space.

Michael left his shuttle seeing the obsidean plane in front of him. Officers and soldiers from the transport Omicron 1 and the shuttle were already waiting there.
<br><br>A general of the Fallen showed Michael that he wanted to speak to him. A officer with a field communicator followed him.
<br><br>"Michael, Omicron 2 isn't responding anymore, Omicaron 3 and 4 have landed, they are on the way to our position. Omicron 3 wasn't able to land near the place where Admiral Skywaler crashed, but Ensign Leole Skirata found the admiral. They are both on their way here."
<br><br>"I guess we have to wait a bit till everyone is here, Martin, how is the fleet doing."
<br><br>"Wasn't able to contact ..."
<br><br>The sound of a Twin Ion Engine interupted the communication. Shapes of two TIE Bombers appeared in the sky. Everyone in the group started to search for cover. The first of the TIE Bombers started to burn and fell to the ground, half a moment later the second TIE Bomber exploded. SHort later X-Wings of Auric squadrons were fliing over Michael's group.
<br><br>The general returned to Michael: "Lost contact to almost everyone in the fleet. I just got contact to a flight group of Omega squadron, as well as a few X-Wings from Auric and White squadron."
<br><br>"Tell everyone you reach they should join forces above our position. We may need some cover when we try to stop whatever is going on in front of us."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<p class="text">
Straus' attention was diverted from the still shining light as a cackle of static broke through his communicator followed by a message;
<br><br>"Attention, all surviving Fleet pilots! You are to withdraw from your current assignments and enter the atmosphere of the local planet at coordinates Alpha 3503, Foxtrot -1230 to assist Admiral Simon's ground advance.This order is effective immediately!"
<br><br>If pilot's were being diverted from the space battle, things were either going to turn very sour, or already were. Leaning over to look at the X-Wings battered right S-foils, Straus observed that the fire menacing the fighter before had petered out, thanks to the ships fire suppression system and the work of one of White Squadrons many astromech droids, which was even now repairing the engines to the best of it's ability. True, the X-Wing was in bad shape, but it was far from inoperable.
The attack on the Destroyer had also thankfully made Imperial forces issue a recall for Zeta squadron to assist with emergency repair duties ship side. Unmolested by TIE's, Doakes' reformed with his wing to begin the trip into the mysterious planets atmosphere.
<br><br>Under the wing commanders lead, White Squadron dropped into lower orbit, ready to assist the Admiral against whatever threat was rearing it's ugly head. Swooping down over the republican forces, Commodore Aish gave out a broadcast:
<br><br>"White Squadron, at your service Admiral."

Shaking his head, Commander Ory sees the other X-Wings move down into low orbit. "I heard Grand Admiral Simon's orders. How are things up there?" Flight Group Three rejoins the rest of Auric Squadron. "Alright Aurics, name of the game is to give fighter support to the ground assault team down on the surface. I don't want any casualties that could've been prevented by us. Take down all bombers and troop transports that you can, but the bombers are a high priority. Battlegroup Hunter got the first bite so lets finish the meal!"
<br><br>All of Auric Squadron cheers over their squad channel then switch back to flight groups. "Auric Threes, keep an eye out for troop transports. The sky is gonna be filled with easy targets but hardly anyone is gonna be looking for transports. They'll be coming from higher orbit or that temple over there. Eyes peeled and be alert, who knows what else Horus has in store for us." Commander Ory takes his Flight Group and splits from the Squadron as the other two follow suit.

Meanwhile the groups of soldiers had spread over the plane and were sneaking towards the temple. The remnants had positioned two companies of stormtroopers on a perimeter around the temple. A group of dark troopers had been placed on a small hill on that perimeter. The Imperials and the Republican ground forces still had no direct line of sight. A scout returned to Michael and the group of command officers around him, silently showing them on a datapad the positio of the enemy soldiers.
Recognising one of the symbols as dark troopers a Brigadier General used hand signs to oder a special armed group to the left side of the field and followed them. Sounds and lights came from all the Imperial fighters in the athmosphere of the planet. Not very load cause the athmosphere was pretty thin, the artificial reactors creating the athmosphere had broken millenias ago. But they could still catch the attaction of the soldiers on the field, or didn't they.

<p class="text">
The lower atmosphere buzzed with activity, sprays of red and green laser fire etched it's way through the occasional thick pink cloud that dotted the noon sky. Now, here, the terms were equal. In fact, if truth be told, the odds were stacked against the remnant forces. Their sluggish TIE bombers did their best to maneuver out of the cross hairs of the attacking republican craft, but the combined agility of squadrons of X-Wings and numerous other high performance craft made short work of the lingering enemy squadrons.
The Remnants transports fared little better, but as the case always was with the old Empire, they were slowly gaining an advantage via their large numbers. Every enemy fighter taken down would seemingly only signal another craft arriving into the planets atmosphere from the space above. Still, the pilot's of 5th fleet persevered, and continued to cover the ground advancement as best as they could.
<br><br>Locking eyes on a damaged TIE bomber, Straus jabbed his thumb down onto the fire button protruding from the edge of the X-Wings joystick. Two neat trails of red fire leaped from either side of the cockpit, and collided with the large bomber target. It's engines stuttered, then failed as it entered a downward spiral headed for the world below, it's descent marked by a large plume of acrid black smoke. As if on schedule, another wing of bombers appeared into view, and as with their comrades, they were making their way straight for the temple structure below.
Pulling the X-Wing around in an arc, Straus sighted another target and clasped the fire button again...

Malso approached the battlefield, it was the most hellish thing he had ever seen! Laser fire and explosions rocked around him, he saw a huge amount of TIE's being shot down. It appeared that the Republic was dominating. He saw a squadron of enemy TIE Bombers. He aimed at one of them, and unleashed a hell of bolts on a TIE Bomber! He got the perfect hit, the TIE exploded and the fragments fell to the surface. Malso got his first kill!
<br><br>He then flew over to a Troop Transport being escorted by about 6 TIE Bombers he openened fire. He destroyed 2 TIE Bombers befroe they could even fight back! He then opened fire on the transport he hit the cockpit and the unlucky transport crash landed on the surface!
<br><br>Unfortunately, Malso had forgoten to get rid of the 4 other TIE's and they were now spraying him with the deadly bolts. He tried a number of manuvers but he could'nt shake them off!

Hearing the distress call, Commander Ory spots Ensign Lokar's X-Wing on his CMD. Diving away from his flight group he barrel rolls behind the four TIEs and Lokar's fighter. Blasting away two of them, James switches to single fire and pops off warning shots to the other two. The remaining TIEs take the bait and veer away from Lokar. Attempting to get behind James' X-Wing, the rest of his flight group fly in from opposite angles and blast away the two "Eyeballs".
<br><br>"You alright Ensign?" Commander Ory flies right next to Ensign Lokar as Ory's flight group flies back into the fray.

Rear Admiral Skywaler was glad that Ensign Leole Skirata found him at his crash site, and brought him back to reality. The reason being Skirata new a lot about Mike that most people did know about beside the fact Mike and Skirata are best buddies that work together on many mercenary contracts with both the Republic and the Empire that they had to rescue each other from problems like this. The Bes'uliik class starfighter rocked with hellish explosions and laser fire from Remnants Storm troopers on the ground.
Right before Mike ordered his friend to land the Bes'suliik near the Republic transport that just landed with reinforcement to help reinforce the current troop numbers that Grand Admiral Simon deployed on the surface. Soon after Mike jumped clear from the fighter and gave his last set of orders to Skirata to start strafing runs on enemy positions. Mike felt his former Master through the force a few clicks to the north near the some sort of temple structure. Active his light saber that he unclipped from his belt Rear Admiral Skywaler rushed over and into the hellish battlefield and heading towards his former Master's last known position.
Just like old times Mike thought as batted away laser bolts left and right.

The horizon of the planet was the thin stripe between the darkness of the planet and the darkness of space where the thin athmosphere of the panet was reflecting the light of the star. The day had begun on this side of the planet and the light of the old sun slowely started to colorise the battlefield. Commander James Ory was the first looking to the horizon, not cause of the view, more cause of the three-winged fighters appearing there. A squadron of TIE Defenders was returning from a partol on the opposite side of the planet and deep enough in the athmosphere to avoid being on the radar screens of the Republican units.
And the TIE Defender traditionally had a gigantic hunger for X-Wings.
<br><br>Michael saw Rear Admiral Skywaler and Ensign Skirata comming when he was discussing the situation with two generals and a few staff officers.
<br><br>One of the generals reported: "The dark troopers are making some problems, but we can deal with the stromtroopers. Most of their contingents are sticked to that perimeter which isn't the best place for defense. May take some time but we can break their resistance."
<br><br>"We don't have that time." Michael replied: "We have to ensure they aren't doing again what they did in the temple a second time. make a concentrated ambush on the western side of the perimeter. If you manage to break through the defense line proceed to the temple yourself. In each case they will move troops from other points of the perimeter to the western side to strengthen this point against your attack. This should give me the possibility to sneak through their lines with a small team and reach the temple."
<br><br>"The first one that reaches the temple and survives pays the drinks."
<br><br>"Like every time."

"Damn.." Commander Ory mutters under his breath and switches to fleet wide communication. "All fighters, this is Commander Ory of Auric Squadron. I just spotted a squadron of TIE Defenders closing in. I don't know how many more squads Horus has but keep an eye out."
<br><br>Switching back to his personal flight group channel, James forms up with his fellow Aurics and they begin to engage the deadly fighters. "Don't try to beat em with strength and speed, you gotta use your brain to fight em'. We all know how dumb TIE pilots are...so lets outsmart em'!"

As the dogfights in the atmosphere became even heavier, the fleet's efforts to stem the flow of enemy bombers were starting to fall to the wayside. TIE numbers were simply too thick for the small squadrons of fighters to prevent them from reaching the deeper atmosphere. Despite a minimal loss of pilots for the fleet, the mission was still turning into a failure, as a number of bombers were slipping through the ever loosening grip that the republicans were trying to excerpt on the Remnant forces.
<br><br>Turning his eyes planet ward, Straus pursued one of the escaping bombers, determined not to let it reach the ground advance below. Locking his X-Wings reticule on the TIE's spherical cockpit, Straus fired one of the torpedoes he had spare from the previous orbital assault on the Super Star Destroyer. The torpedo smashed into the TIE, ripping straight through it's chassis and detonating just clear of the bombers front end, sending it spiraling down into the ground below, a shower of debris marking its descent.
<br><br>Pleased with another kill to mark onto his vessel after the battle, Straus let a somewhat egotistical grin emerge across his face. However, the next thing he saw wiped the grin straight from his face. Emerging over a mountain range to the north were the unmistakable silhouettes of a squad of TIE Defenders. Not sufficiently hyped up by taking down a pair of TIE bombers to take on a suicide run, Straus pulled his fighter back up into the higher atmosphere, hoping that the Defenders had not spotted him amongst the pitifully inadequate cloud covering.
Hoping to warn the rest of the pilot's still dealing with the bombers and transports, Straus suddenly heard the Commander's transmission. Albeit a few minutes later than he would have liked.

Malso had been pretty shaken up by the 4 TIE Bombers fire. He had taken severe damage to his right wing but, was still determined to keep fighting hard.
<br><br>Malso then saw a squadron of TIE Defenders he armed his proton torpedos, and fired two at the incoming squadron. Both the torpedos hit and destroyed their targets!
<br><br>He heard about their tough sheilds and dangerous armament so he tried to pick them off as fast as possible with his laser cannons but their shields were too strong!
<br><br>The TIE's were chasing him now! They blasted him with their laser cannons. His already highly damaged right wing broke off!!!!
<br><br>Malso's X-Wing spiraled out of control! He crashed to the surface. Luckily, Malso was okay he was'nt even injured and he did'nt even pass out.

Chaos was ruling the battle in the orbit while both sides were desperatly trying to regain the control over the situation. The TIE Defenders were obviouly commander by one of their more experianced Remnant officers. He ordered the lose TIE Fighters and even TIE Bombers around to fill the empty spots in his squadron. The remaing Republican fighters tried to regroup theirself in exoticly mixed flight groups. The pilots used all their training, knowledge and instincts to form up their lines again and not fall into the Chaos which would surely cause the end of their battle.
<br><br>After the attack on the western side snipers were clearing the way for Michael, Mike Skywaler, Leole Skirata and maybe half a dozend more soldiers to the temple. They sneaked through one of the minor entrences into the great cyclic hall.
<br><br>In the middle of the hall was a big deep round shaft. Two large bridges out of this black stone enforced with some metal structures leading over the shaft building a cross. In the middle of the cross was a platform with a 3 meters high crystal cylinder in the middle. Around the cylinder were three stone statues of cloacked figures and 6 real cloaked figures in praying position around them. Maybe 8 Imperial officers and 2 Dark Troopers standing loosely on the platform as well.
<br><br>The explosion of the main gate and the entry of the Fallen general with a group or Republican soldiers catched the attraction of persons in the middle of the Hall and also Michael's team started to fire from the other side. The Dark Troopers started their Jetpacks and tried to jump over the shaft, but the concentrated fire of several Republican soldiers interupted them. One of them had a mailfunction in the jetpack after a blaster hit and fallen into the shaft, the other one crashed with one of the halls of the temple after being hitten by a rocket and tried to recove his funtionality there.
<br>The officers were triing to find cover somewhere on the platform and returning fire with their blaster pistols. Two of the cloaked figures directly died in fire, three others ignited their red blades and made large superhuman jumps over the shaft the last cloaked figure made a step back and felt into the shaft. Michael quickly ran forward jumping in the shaft as well.
<br><br>Mike Skywaler and Leole Skirata wanted to follow him when one of the cloaked figures landed in front of them. It was a 2.10 meters tall human with pale white skin black hair a black robe and a twin saber with a red blade.

The confusion, and destruction, that the TIE Defenders had caused was evident in the now mixed layout of the Republican fighter squadrons. White Squadron was one of the more lucky squadrons, losing only roughly a fifth of its vessels. Other squadrons were more heavily hit by the Defenders ceaseless onslaught of fire. Most pilots were down to using laser fire, their torpedoes spent hours ago. The shield defenses of the Defenders were more than adequate enough to prevent most laser fire, and so now in desperation, devastated squadrons joined together with others and began to take the Defenders on with four ships attacking at a time.
Despite being a somewhat clumsy effort, the strategy succeeded in lowering a single Defenders shields enough for a killing blow to be struck. It was slow work however, and the other Defenders of the wing were causing ample havoc on Republican forces.
<br><br>All was not dark though, the flow of TIE Bombers from orbit had been seemingly stemmed, as no new ships were arriving from orbit. Either the Remnant command had seen their efforts as being futile and given up sending valuable ships to be destroyed with little profit, or the Remnant forces in orbit had retreated. In short, the only Bombers left to deal with were now flying in the damaged wings of Defenders, their role more as cannon fodder than any real support.
<br><br>Flying side by side with a fellow White Squadron X-Wing and a Y-Wing with markings he did not recognize, Straus and his makeshift wing began an attack run on one of the Defenders that had become isolated from it's squadron. As heavy laser fire sent waves of energy casting across the Defenders shield system, Straus hoped that for both the air and ground forces sake, the assault on the temple was coming to a close. Hopefully, a close beneficial to the forces of the New Republic...

Michael was landing on another bridge 15 meters deep in the shaft. Force jump wasn't really Michael's favorite, his legs didn't like the landing too much. He recovered pretty fast, seeing Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sumnin standing in front of him wearing a white uniform of a Grand Admiral. The cloak was lying somewhere behind on the bridge. The blade of Michael's lightsaber was crossing the one of Horus before anyone of both even had started to speak.
<br><br>"This is interesting." Horus started: "Haven't used lightsabers for maybe ten years now."
<br><br>"Indeed a pretty traditional way to solve this conflict."
<br><br>Horus made an attack but Michael slightly parried.
<br><br>"Maybe leading your fleet here wasn't the best move." Michael commented.

Before Mike could yell at Ensign Skirate to move out of the way,the 2.10 meters tall human with pale white skin black hair a black robe and a twin saber with a red blade made the first move not long after it landed infront of them. Quickly acting to the black rob human,Mike slightly parried the attcked away.Before making his counter attack with quick and eased slashes at the Sith,with everyone move Mike made the Sith countered it with his twin saber.Come on I know I can handle this guy Mike thought as he picked himself up becuase the Sith Warrior force push Mike to the ground.
Right after Mike got to his feet, he gave the Sith the same treatment followed by kick to the stomach when he quickly got back up.

Straus sensed that the battle was in it's end phase. The fight in the atmosphere was dieing down, only a handful of TIE Defenders were left to drag hostilities on. The pilots in the Defenders were particularly tenacious however, and insisted on fighting to the bitter last man. Pockets of laser fire were exchanged between a few Republican fighters and the remaining TIE's, while the rest of the fleet in the atmosphere reassembled to begin the final set of runs that would hopefully defeat the Defenders. Looking up through the X-Wings canopy, Straus could spot the shapes of the 5th Fleets capital ships drifting in orbit.
From his limited perspective, Straus summarized that his comrades in orbit had recovered well from the unidentified blast of light that emanated from the planet.
<br><br>Forming up with White Squadron, the fighters in the atmosphere descended below the clouds and began a fly over of the temple structure. The covert ground intrusion had caused a rather large dent in the Remnant ground forces, but there was still a noticeable platoon of troops assembling at the temple entrance. And behind that, a pair of AT-ST's. These Remnant forces were remarkably well equipped, and consequently remarkably dangerous. Whatever the Admiral and his team were doing inside the structure, once they'd finished it they would run straight into the ambush that the Remnant forces were even now setting up.
But then, that was what air support was for. Lining up for a shot at one of the AT-ST's, Straus braced himself for another difficult battle. A winnable battle.

A rocket was hitting one of the crossing bridges close to the platform fireing stone fragments of the bridge all through the room. Two Imperial officers directly died in the explosion, the surviving ones tried to escape from the central platform.
<br><br>"By the way, did I mention that now is a good point for giving up." Michael said fighting Horus on the lower bridge: "Your conquest of the galaxy has found an end, with your remaining fleet you will get problems even conquering an unhabitated moon."
<br><br>"Maybe you're right, but I have made different plans for today."
<br><br>Horus used the force to break the battle damaged briges above then and drag the platform down in the shaft. Both made some quick jumps backward before the falling platform took the small service bridge with it. Michael had managed to grip the service ladder on one side of the bridge not even a second before the bridge was no more. When he looked back he couldn't see Horus anymore, just the opened door of a service tunnel on the other side of the shaft. Michael was looking on the other side a few moments, but he knew he wouldn't make a jump over there, so he climbed the service ladder up to the hall again.

As the second AT-ST fell to the ground under a volley of fire from White Squadron, a gigantic explosion rocked the ground beneath the fleets pilots. An enormous plume of smoke rose from the temple, obscuring everything below eye level.
<br><br>The pilot's efforts had removed most of the enemy ground opposition, but there were still a number of troops holding their position, ignorant of their surrounding literally falling to nothing around them. If nothing, the Remnants troops were certainly determined. With a thick cloud of smoke from the temple incident hanging low to the ground, there was no way of telling what the pilot's would be hitting with their indiscriminate fire. The only solution was to hold position and wait for the smoke to clear, which would hopefully happen before the ground team reached the surface and the remaining Remnant ambush.

Before the battle damage platform came crashing down into the shaft,not long after rocket blasted away one of the crossing bridges near the platform showing it with fragments of the bridge all over the room.This didn't bother Mike one bit as he contuie his lightsaber battle with the Sith Warrior that finally screwed up. Which Mike took the moment to make his killing blow to the Sith Warrior before he flet someone using the force to bring the platform down into the shaft.Mike knowing that his freind was already safe or ducking it out with Hours Dark Troops topside near the temple entrance.
Mike force leap down into the shaft along with the platform.

The 5th fleet had meanwhile formed up again and returned with the rest of the fleet of warlord Horus back to the orbit of the planet. Vice Admiral Mattias Gustafsson was still commanding the remaining squadrons.
<br><br>"Sir we identified a uncloaked TIE Phantom."
<br><br>"Quickly, send a flight group of Crimson or Auric there before it cloakes again."
<br><br>"Just disappearing in the hangar of the SSD."
<br><br>"He won't be able to hide there for long."
<br><br>The SSD started to accelerate to full speed followed by the five ISDs which remained operational. It tokk them 2 minutes breaking through the lines of the 5th fleet and moving into hyperspace position. The SSD and three of the ISDs made their way into hyperspace. While trying to go into hyperspace the damaged reactor of one of the 4th ISD collapsed and broke the ship into two parts. The engines of the 5th ISDs were damaged to much and simply flaied when trying to jump into hyperspace.
<br><br>The other remaining SSD was to close to the planet to reach a position where it could move into hyperspace and was too much damaged to fight a way ot there, so the Admiral commanding the ship capitulated. Few of the TIE Defenders and other smaller vessels with hyperspace had jumped out with the fleet. The remaining Imperial forces followed the capitulation.
<br><br><br>Few minutes earlier Grand Admiral Simon was standing in the hall of the temple. Just Republican soldiers were remaining and 3 captive Imperial officers. Rear Admiral Skywaler had followed Michael after he noticed that warlord Horus had escaped.
<br><br>The general of the ground forces spoke to Michael: "Admiral the Imperials seem to have bigger contingents of ground forces then we have expected. The temple here isn't good to defend. I suggest we withdraw to our earlier position and fight against the Remnants there."
<br><br>"Agreed general."
<br><br>The Republican soldiers quickly removed from the temple before a contingent of Stromtroopers stormed the temple. Just took a few minutes this the Imperials halted their progress. A soldier with a field communication reported of the capitulation of the Remnants.
<br><br><br>It took another few minutes till a group of four Republic Class Stardestroyers jumped out of hyperspace. "Looks like we get reinforced." said Commy to Raul with a slight ironical undertone.
<br><br><br>One and a half hour had passed. High Admiral Corran 'Commskywalker' Skywalker and Grand Admiral Michael Simon were still discussing the situation of the captured SSD with the admiral of the other Republican fleet and the Republican High Command via holonet. High Admiral Darth 'Worf' Angelus had made a small celebration for a couple of officers who got promoted after the battle for extraordinary bravery. Less then hundret officers where on the celebration. Straus Doakes, Leole Skirata and Malso Lokar were holding their new Second Lieutenant rank signs and also Commander James Ory got promoted to Captain.
<br><br>Vice Admiral Wolverine was waiting for Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler in the captain's office on the ASD Prometheus. Mike Skywaler was saluting when he entered the office.
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>"Admiral Skywaler, you were doing pretty good out there."
<br><br>"Thanks, sir."
<br><br>"Well the position of captain of the Prometheus was vacant for long enough now, I decided you get the captain of the ship. You can start with moving your belongs to your new office. You're first task will be finding a talented officer succeding you as Wing Commander. There is something more ..."
<br><br><br>Later that day Michael was sitting in his office with Admiral Arial May and Vice Admiral Wolverine making a few minutes pause from reviewing reports. He started looking throughout the window. This war was over, a war the fleet fought over several years now.
