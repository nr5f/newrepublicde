<b>Phase III</b>
<br>
<br>"The encryption of the comm channels complete?" Michael asked one of the communication officers.
<br>
<br>"Yes, admiral."
<br>
<br>Michael moved a few steps ahead so the holotransmitter could track him better.
<br>
<br>"Greetings officers of the New Republican Navy.
<br>
<br>Well some of you may have already asked, why we are here. This isn't the main frontline of our conflict with the Remnant warlord and we are surely not enough to challange Horus realm out own, so what are we doing here.
<br>
<br>Our first main targets are the two Superstardestroyers of the Black Dagger Legion. They have a similar cloaking device like the SSD Terror so we can't track them and take them out, so we are provoking them to find us. Basically what we are doing is to wait here till Horus formed an assault against us.
<br>
<br>Sounds like a totally stupid plan, and it surely is, but good plans didn't have too much success in the past assaults on Horus.
<br>
<br>What if Horus don't attacks us. Well in that case we will destroy his military installations here and in the neighboring systems and return into Republican space to find another part of his empire to destabelize.
<br>
<br>What happens if he attacks us. Well Horus has a couple of forces available in this system. A couple of stardestroyers. But his main forces are surely the two Superstardestroyers. They also have the most modern equippment. One wing of a TIE Phantom variant, one wing Assault Bombers each of the SSDs.
<br>
<br>Horus knows our strength, why should we have a chance to win, he will surely attack us with enough forces make sure he will win. Well, Horus' forces in this sector are limited as well. We won't give him enough time to get enough forces together, we will remove from here early enough to prevent giving Horus enough time to build up a fleet that is too big. And Horus is fighting on other fronts as well.
<br>
<br>Well another aspect is, we have advanced the Sniffler. The Sniffler 2 missle only makes half of the damage of an Advanced Concussion Missle and hasn't the target lock as that missle, but it's able to track cloaked fighters and on detonation it's disableing the cloakind device for a few seconds so it's possible attacking the target with other weapons as well in that time window.
<br>
<br>Usually I like to have all strategical advances in a battle I can get, but this time we simply have to face our opponent and decide this battle by our skills on the battleground and by our will to win, more then by our large plans. It's time to and the chapter of this universe that started when the Sith Lord Palpetine gained control over the Republic.
<br>
<br>Those of us still opperational after the battle fill follow the Remnant convoi routes backwards to their root and attack the heart of Horus dominion. Horus had lost a couple of ships of his Black Dagger Legion in the last years, others are in progress to be repaired, so Intel beleaves he is producing a second generation of Superstardestroyers for his Black Dagger Legion. We donno the progress of that project, may take months, may take years till completion. But we don't know if we get another chance on an assault that soon again.
<br>
<br>May the force be with you."
<br>
<br>After Michael had spoken the Zentar broughtcasted a holotransmission from High Admiral Horn on the same channel.
<br>
<br>"One addition to the topic of the Grand Admiral. Battlegroups Zentar and Hunter are still looking for volunteers for piloting recon X-Wings into the neigboring systems to see if Horus is preparing an attack. Please contact your Wing Commanders or Carrier Captains on that topic."
<br><br>
<br>Michael was watching transporters docking on the Prometheus. The snifflers had been to valuable to transport them on one of the freighters, so they had used the limited cargo space of the Prometheus for that freight. Meanwhile 50 snifflers missles were tranported to each of the other carriers trough the transports while other transports were refilling the space that got free with food, normal ammunition and other supplies again.

<p class="text">
Wolverine stepped to the side to talk to Simon in private. "Sir, I have a proposition. Send Thes and myself undercover to infiltrate Horus's navy. We could give a heads up on all of his activities."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Wolverine</p>
<p class="text">
"Maybe after the operation is done we can try to infiltrate him before we give Horus the rest. Currently I'm expeting an assault from Horus against our position within the next 20 hours, and besides the fleet needs every experianced officer on battlestations in case we need to push that assault back, it's not enough time to infiltrate him.
<br>
<br>First of all we have a couple of Remnant warlords and their fleets that joined Horus. They are controlling their planets or regions which are usually spread over the border regions of Horus realm. Their equipment is usually outdated and they build the lowest level of Horus control. The second level consist of Horus regular fleets. Basically what we have fought here. Units with more or less modern Imperial equipment. They are under the direct control of Horus' commanders and control the strategical important systems in the border regions and the largest parts of the territories of Horus' controlled region. They are also the main forces in his wars against the Republic or opponent Remnants. The third level control his central region. We don't know exactly where these regions are, but Intel has analysed the sensor logs of your attacks against the convois.
They have found equipment transported on the freighters that had it's origin in Horus' higher advanced factories in his central regions, and I hope we can follow the trail of these convois back to these regions. Well we call the unit defending this regions black dagger legion, cause their Stardestroyers have black hulls. They operate out of the central region as well. Infiltrating them is nearly impossible. 90% of their soldiers and crewmembers jumped out of tanks. And the normal humans in the black legion are usually veterans from Horus other fleets that have served there for some time. I guess it's kinda impossible infiltrating them within the very limited time we have at the moment.
<br>
<br>... When the opperation is done, we took out the two Superstardestroyers here, proceeded to Horus main ship yards, surprised him there and did as much damage as we are able too before we returned we can do larger opperations against Horus where we surely will find time to infitrate him, but currently we have a time window from less then 5 days for the ntire opperation. Not enough time to get deep enough into Horus structures to find out nessesary informations for the mission."

Liedan walked twards Iceman quarters.
<br>
<br>"Sir Lieutenant Liedan Aish requesting permition to join the recon groop from the predetor." He qeustioned threw the dore.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Liedan Aish</p>
<p class="text">
Mike knocked on Tax's doors to Tax's quarters. The only reason he was there at Tax's quarters. Was to see if he can lead a recon squadron. So he take the squadron to scout the near by system for Horus' ships . That was near their poisition.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
After listening to the breifing James heads towards Tax's quarters. When he approaches he sees Mike standing, requesting the same thing he was. That recon mission. He and Chrome are ready for the mission. Walking up and next to Mike, James says, "Sir, I too would like to be part of that recon mission. My R2 unit and I are ready for it sir." Saluting and standing at attention he tried to look as professional as possible.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Returning the salute. " I see. Have someone to stand here with me untill Tax answer the door to his quarters." Mike simled and laughed all the sametime. Then Mike knocked again to see if Tax heared it this time. I hope I came at the right time to to do this Mike thought as he brought down his hand.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
With a bit of impatience in his voice James asks, "I can't wait, I hope we're picked. Watch, we'll be the first people to find Horus! Then we'll take that Imperial pig down!" Pretending to punch the warlord with his bare fists he laughs a bit and calms down.

<b>Grand Admiral Simon's office, ASD Prometheus</b>
<br>
<br>Michael was sleeping in his chair, his head was lying on his desk. He had been awake for more then 20 hours in the opperations and fallen asleep while waiting in his office for something happening. An Lieutenant Commander in Imperial uniform was knocking on the door of the Admiral, when Simon didn't reply he entered the office and Michael woke up.
<br>
<br>"Admiral, you wanted to be informed in case one we get a identification from one of the Diffusion Sensors or loose contact to one of them. And we have lost the contact to the coreward sensor again. A transport has already been sent to replace the sensor aagin."
<br>
<br>"Is the fleet on silent alarm again?"
<br>
<br>"The admirals decided to check the situation first, since we have already lost the coreward sensor earlier again through the asteroids in the region."
<br>
<br>"Well, then it's about time to give the alarm. I know the fleet needs more time for recovering, but we aren't really at the place where we could do that."
<br>
<br>Michael was leaving the office after the Lieutenant Commander, to get some coffee. A few seconds later a coded signal coded in the normal communication between the ships and some of the squadrons on long range partols got orders to return to the carriers under all kind of reasons.
<br>
<br><b>Briefing Room 3, ISD Hamburg XII</b>
<br>
<br>Commodore Gessinger was looking over the group of pilots in black Imperial pilot suits where the Imperial logos had been replaced through Republican ones. Looked like everyone was there.
<br>
<br>"Ok, the situation is the following. We have lost more then 6 minutes ago the contact to a sensor in the coreward region of the planetary system, and I just got the Informations 2 minute ago a group of 5 stardestroyers appeared on the radars. Details on the Stardestroyers as soon as I have the radar prints."
<br>
<br>Commodore Gessinger was loading a map of the local system into the memory of the holoprojector of the Briefing Romm and pressed some buttons to display the map. A couple of green icons symbolised the Republican ships in the system. He used a sensor staff to point on a location, then he pressed some buttons to order the graphical processor to display some red icons on the holoprojection on the place he pointed at.
<br>
<br>"That should be the location of the Remnant fleet. They should be 12 to 15 minutes away from here."
<br>
<br>The commodore used the stick to another group of red icons on the map between the position of the other group of red icons and the green icons around the small image of the planet.
<br>
<br>"That could be the position of one or two SSDs of the Black Dagger Legion, Horus's elite, mentioned in the meetings before. The SSDs have radar and optical stealth devices. They are maybe 5 minutes ahead from the position of the other Remnant ships, maybe to surprise us with their attack, maybe to intercept our thought assaults on the other Remnant fleet. Each of the SSDs are equipeed with one wing of Horus' version of the TIE Phantom and one wing of TIE Assault Bombers. The Phantoms can start cloaked, just they can't land cloaked. While the SSDs are cloacked they can't send radar transmissions to other ships, same counts for the Phantoms. Ships can't land on the SSDs while the cloaking device is on and Phantoms can't fly in formations while they are cloaked. So one of the Phantom pilot don't knows what the other one does. Sure if we would send out fighters and bombers to attack the other remnant fleet, they would surely start fighters to take these squadrons out.
<br>
<br>To fight blind we have the Sniffler 2. The Sniffler 2 follows the trail of hot ion gas any every twin ion engine emits. It can hunt any TIE, but don't follows ships with Republican ID codes. The damage is just half of the normal advanced concussion missle, so a single hit won't destroy a Phantom, but you should be able to give the Phantom the rest with your lasers, cause the Sniffler disables the cloaking device as well for some seconds to minutes.
<br>
<br>Every ship has only a load of small amount of these Snifflers, so every ship can just equip a single squadron with Snifflers, and each fighter of that squadron would just be equipped with 4 missles. On the Hamburd Phi squadron will be equipped with Snifflers.
<br>
<br><b>Bridge, BB Zentar</b>
<br>
<br>Some minutes later, psylor was checking a screen with radar scans, Admiral Horn was standing on the other side of the bridge.
<br>
<br>"Admiral, We had lost two, fighters out of nothing, the entire fleet is loosing fighters." a Commander reportet to Psylor.
<br>
<br>"Fire the Metion torpedos blind immideatly." Psylor returned.
<br>
<br>All ships were fireing the torpedos and they were exploding closely and waves of Metions were filling the regions around the Republican warships. The shields around the X-Wings started to glow blueish and they dropped a few percent. But not only the shields of the X-Wings we glowing. Somehow empty blue glowing spheres were fliing around. The cloaking device of the Phantom was pretty small, strong enough to block the electro magnetical waves a Phantom emitts, but not when the Phantom was glowing like an asteroid burning when entering the athmoshpere of a planet.
<br>
<br>"Well, we don't have a second load of Metion torpedos and the Phantons will only be visible for a few minutes, so start hunting." Psylor sent in a radio transmission to the fighters ouut there.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
As Mike watch the Ensign do his punching in his hand display. Mike smiled and keep the talk going untill Tax answers.
<br>
<br>" James that was nice and funny at the sametime. But there are other plans for Horus by the Grand Admiral. Plus we don't know if we going to do the recon around in this sector and I know you are ready for the recon duty. Its not that easy to do trust me on this. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Hearing no answer Liedan figured he wasn’t in turned and pivoted on his heel then walked off.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Liedan Aish</p>
<p class="text">
Letting out a bit of a sigh, he responds, "Yeah, I guess your right. I am a bit nervous though..if we are picked for recon duty, what'll happen if we run into Horus' fleet and end up getting blasted out of the sky almost instantly?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Rear Admiral Wolverine and DarkStar Squadron were assigned to the ASD Prometheus for the week-long assignment while the CRS Payback headed back to the Bilbringi Shipyards for repairs. The recent report of the lost sensor was enough to get him up on the bridge. He joined the Grand Admiral and awaited a report.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Wolverine</p>
<p class="text">
" The recon or scout sometime don't have weapons and relie on support fighters that come with them. There are sometime people go on the recon duty and sometime don't make it back. If they are lucky to make it out when the support fighter are covering them."
<br>Then Mike to out his datapad to see if there is any news for the fleet or any orders, As Mike looked at the screen on his datapad. This not good at all Mike thought as he just read the report about a group of 5 stardestroyers came in through the area were a sensor grid went down. Mike looked up at Ensign Ory after he read the information and put his datapad way.
<br>
<br>"Ensign, head to the briefing room . Something just came up and I like to breif the squad about the information I just read. "
<br>
<br>Then Mike took out his comlink to contact the remaining Auric Squadron members.
<br>
<br>" Auric Squdron this is your Senior Officer of Auric Squadron head to the breifing room,Commander Skywaler out. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Is everything ok? I have a feeling something bad is gonna happen.." Turning around the ensign heads towards the breifing room to await what Mike has to say to him and the rest of the squad.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
In the breifing room were the Pedator's pilots brief before they go into a battle with the Empire. Mike watch the pilots of Auric squadron fall in into the breifing room and waiting on Mike had to say to them.
<br>
<br>" Ok, Aurics we have lost more then 6 minutes ago the contact to a sensor in the coreward region of the planetary system, and I just got the Informations a minute ago a group of 5 stardestroyers appeared on the radars. Right now I don't have the details on the Stardestroyers as soon as I have the radar prints. I'll let you all know about them and send them to you. "
<br>
<br>Mike keyed and loaded up the map of the local system into the memory of the holoprojector of the Briefing Room and pressed some buttons to display the map. Mike pressed some more buttions and green icons of New Republican Ships were showing on the holoprojector. Mike used a sensor staff to point at the a location of the ships in system.Then he pressed some buttons to order the graphical processor to display some red icons on the holoprojection on the place he pointed at were the Star Destroyers came in at.
<br><br>
<br>"This should be the location of the Remnant fleet of Warlord Horus. "
<br>
<br>Mike looked at the pilots of Auric Squadron and two members of in the squad spoke up because they both had something to say to Mike about he was saying in the briefing. Before Mike went on with the breifing of the information he just got.
<br>
<br>" Yes, Ensign Ory and Ensign Sweeney.? "
<br>
<br>Before Ensign Sweeney spoke Jame did first.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
“How exactly is one ship gonna stop five Star Destroyers by ourselves? I mean if that is Horus' fleet, it might have a SSD along for the ride! We'd get massacred!" James says this with concern in his tone. A Venenator-class vessel with X-Wings and Y-Wings would barely be enough to stop them. Also, the threat of TIE Phantoms concerns him more than the cruisers themselves.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" I see where you are going with this Ensign. This is were we are at in the Ogompak system of its outer planets. Where we just attack the Dreadnaught and the Fnarit Klirr Zeta station. Also we are already heading back to Ogompak III after the battle we just had."
<br>
<br>Mike using the sensor staff pointing at where the Predator is at the time and space.
<br>
<br>" Also if Warlord Horus SSDs deside to attack the fleet where we are the most gather at. If that happens everyone will be called to point where the SSDs are attacking at. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Ash sat in the Officer's Mess aboard the Prometheus idly prodding the Mynock stew with his fork whilst the steward who'd assured him that it was a delicacy looked on expectantly. Glancing around him Ash noticed his comm lying on the floor and reached for it, glancing at the screen he noticed an unread message, and stood up hoping to murmur a brief explanation before heading for the Bridge only to find the steward already gone. He moved to walk away but almost by impulse turned backed and ate a chunk of the Stew before moving off and breaking into a run. It may only be a sensor problem with the ship but right now Ash would rather attack the death star on a speeder bike than go back to that stew.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Ash Halcyon</p>
<p class="text">
"Ah, I see. So those destroyers are no where near us at the current time..correct?" James asks with curiosity, studying the holo-map that sits infront of him.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" As of right now yes. Plus the group of five Star Destroyers can also be the position were the SSDs are. Each of the SSDs are equiped with one wing of Horus' version of the TIE Phantom and one wing of TIE Assault Bombers. Also both the TIE Phantoms and the SSDs are equiped with a cloaking device. The Phantoms can start as being cloaked during flight, just they can't land while being cloaked. While the SSDs are cloacked they can't send radar transmissions to other ships, same counts for the Phantoms. Ships can't land on the SSDs while the cloaking device is on and Phantoms can't fly in formations while they are cloaked. So one of the Phantom pilot don't knows what the other one does. As of right now this is all the information I have. When I get more I'll send if to your datapads with more details. Also right now until Rear Admiral Gustafsson and the Predator get more orders from the Grand Admiral. We are on stand by until we get new orders. Dismissed."
<br>
<br>Mike turned around and looked at the holoprojector. Also looking at the data on the screen on the holoprojector and rereading the data of the down grid sensor. This is not right at all Mike thought as he read the data again. So he contact Tax and see if they have anything new orders from the Grand Admiral.
<br>
<br>"Commander Skywaler to Rear Admiral Gustafsson, As of right now do we have any orders from the Grand Admiral..? "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Turning around, James decides to test out his new simulator program. He's trying to develop a way to reveal the TIE Phantoms when they're cloaked. So far he hasn't had any luck, but the tatic is to fire a chaff burst in a warhead. So when the warhead explodes the chaff lands on the the TIE Phantoms to reveal where they are. The fighters are still cloaked but the bursts of energy cover the fighters. Unfortunetly, when the burst is released the computer SIM makes the fighters barrel roll and the burst fly off the ships, then proceed to destroy James' TIE Defender, in which he practices in.
<br>
<br>Looking at the results screen after the program ended, he finnaly got his secret tatic to work. He found out that a laser burst would disrupt the cloaking mechanisim and cause the cloaking device to fail, thus revealing the ship, but the device is only disabled for about three seconds, just enough to launch a missile into the fighter. So his new plan now is to use the chaff as a countermeasure, have a TIE Phantom pursue him, then have a wingman take out the fighter. "Easy, I hope. Let's see if this is easy on paper and in real life."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Michael was standing with other command officers on the bridge. There were just a few minutes remaining where the Phantoms were visible.
<br>
<br>"The fighters all out there?" Michael was asking one of the Wing Commanders of the Prometheus, Vice Admiral Stuart.
<br>
<br>"Having problems getting all squadrons briefed and ready."
<br>
<br>"Well, we need more fighters out there. We need to take out the first wave of fighters now, to gain space superiority around our carriers again otherwise they can start their bomber assaults on us."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Walking out of the simulator, James simply glares at the holo-disk he's holding. "Ugh, that didn't work either and I don't think we have any snifflers onboard either. That was a pure disaster, I couldn't see where the Phantoms were coming from, they took me by surprise!" Sulking, James simply puts his simulator program in his pocket, adjusts his uniform and heads towards the hangar to work on his X-Wing that took some damage during the station attack.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Mike didn't get a answer so he went to the hanger bay and check on his X-Wing and Lyn that was doing some repairs on the fighter. When Mike was walking to the hanger bay he felted something that didn't belong there. So he went on towrds the hanger bay. Taking his comlink of his belt to contact the bridge for a diferent reason beacuse he still had the bad feeling he felt through the force.
<br>
<br>"Commander Skywaler to Bridge, is there anything on your rader screens..? "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Finishing his work, James tosses the rag that was covered in black soot into a bucket for cleaning by the matenance droids. Walking up to Crome he asks if the internal systems of his X-Wing is ok. The droid beeps some positive remarks and James smiles at the remark. "Well then, that's good." Glancing over to walk out of the hangar bay, he notices Mike wonder in. "Uh, Commander Skywaler..you ok? You don't look too well." Saying this, after painting over some laser burns on the X-Wing's nose.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" No, Ensign I just ask Bridge they anything on their rader, beacuse I felt something that was out of place that all.."

Several of the TIE Phantoms had been shot down, but under high losses of the Republican defenders.
<br>
<br>The Remnant fleet had moved into formation, so did the Republican fleet. The two SSDs of Horus were visible, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to go in formation with the other ships. Each of the SSDs was starting 5 TIE Assault Bomber Squadrons. The other Remnant stardestroyers were starting their fighters and bombers as well. A mix of everything, from TIE Fighter up to TIE Avengers. Also a small amount of assault transports had been started, building formations with all the corvettes and lancer frigates arounf the Remnant fleet.
<br>
<br>The Republican fleet had a couple of fighter squadrons started as well.
<br><br>
<br>"Admirals, the Remnant fleet has almost deployed then complete fighter and bomber wings." On of the officers was reporting in one of the conference rooms of the ASD Prometheus.
<br>
<br>Michael and a few admiral in Imperial uniforms were standing in the room. The Group Commanders, Carrier Captains and Wing Commanders of the other ships were just present as hologramm.
<br>
<br>"All bombers equipped with concussion missles." Michael asked the officers around him.
<br>
<br>"Aye sir." one of the Wing Commanders of the Prometheus replied.
<br>
<br>"Well, I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised on our opponent. First of all, Horus don't has enough ships in this battle, our ships have more firepowed then Horus' ships and we have massivly more fighters and Horus' commander can't use his technical advance too much in this battle. In this moment they have started their bombers escorted by fighters, we will do the same, but our bombers will be equipped with concussion missles. It should look like we will attack their battleships as well, and in the right moment our fighters and bombers will attack their bombers and not their capitol ships. Maybe our bombers can't deal with TIE Advanced, but they surely have an advantage against TIE Bombers and TIE Assault Bombers especially when they are equipped with concussion missles while the remnants are equipped with torpedos. And together with the fact that we have many more fighters then Horus we should have an advantage of 2 to 1 or 3 to 1 in this part of the battle.
We need to completely wipe out their bombers with the 1st wave. Our fleet will push forward and attack the Remnants in close combat. We have a small advantage in firepower cause we have more bigger ships then they have, and the opponent fighters won't help them much, they need to be reequipped with torpedos first. Their bombers should be down then already."
<br>
<br>"They will surely withdraw once they have mentioned that we have an advantage in the battle." Angelus mentioned.
<br>
<br>"I fear they will do, to be true when I have planned this, I have expected we get encountered by a larger force. Since this fleet is smaller they will more likely withdraw at an earlier point of the battle. Nevertheless, we need to win the battle here first before we can think about the plan again. So everyone, get the squadrons ready.
<br>
<br>...
<br>
<br>Ahh, one point."
<br>
<br>The map was zooming closer to the Remnant fleet. The Remants had the typical dagger formation. Both SSDs were exactly above each other. In the middle height between the SSDs were the other SDs in arrow formation. An ISD, leading the formation. an ISD and an VSD on the left side. Two VSDs on the right side.
<br>
<br>"Well, the formation is pretty much out of a tactical book. Maybe if you command a cloaked ship you usually don't have much experiance with formations. Well, we could let them cut though our formation. Battlegroup One will keep the left flank busy them, while Zentar and Hunter attack the right flank. The VSDs surely have not great chances, you should be able to drive them inward into the formation pretty easyly. The more closer the ships are, the more time they need for coordinating an escape into hyperspace, the more time we have to make damage."

Taking a glance outside of the hangar bay, James notices a Victory Star Destoyer about 12 klicks away from the Predator's posistion. "What the? Why weren't the squadrons sent out yet? We have an enemy Star Destroyer just about 12 to 13 klicks away!"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Get to your ships. " Mike yelled to all pilots that where in the hanger bay. Doing the samething Mike and James where doing to their fighters doing finish fixes. Mike hoped into his fighter and went out of the hanger bay to join the other fighters from the other ships of the Republican Fleet. Has Mike was getting data about the ships he sent them to his squad member that where out here and to the ones that haven't got to their ships. The data was on the blueprints and read out of the Remnant fleet.
<br>
<br>" Lock S-Foils into attack position and  watch out for laser shots from cloaked TIE Phantoms."
<br>Mike said on a open Republican fleet channel.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Why weren't we alerted sooner? My R2 unit did some scans, told me that cruiser popped in about 20 klicks away! I'm also reading several squads of Ghosts(TIE Phantoms) flying out...now I lost em. They're cloaked ladies and gentlemen, so keep an eye out. He then hears 3 "Yes sir" over the commlink. "Hotshot, you got anything on those fighters?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Yes theres is one about two clicks to your right and he is about to fire his lasers at a Y-Wing." Mike said to Ensign Ory as he was using the force to see and sence where the cloaked TIE Phantoms are. As Mike did this he flown into a squad of TIE Bombers from the Remnant fleet. 
<br>
<br>" All fighters protect our TIEs and the captail ship at all cost. " Mike said on the Republican Fleet channel.

<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
James and his flight group fly towards the Y-Wing squadrons, seeing green bolts fly from seeminly nowhere, he attempts to fire from the source of the green lasers. Not hitting the attacker, but hitting his wingmate, pulled off a lucky shot and disabled the cloaking device. The TIE Phantom is now revealed, the rest of his flight group takes out the Phantom. Unfortunetly, James now has a Phantom on his tail and to confirm this, is he sees green laser bursts, but no ship.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Mike did a nice nice barrel rolling, to dodge some laser bolts shots from a TIE fighter. When he notice green laser bolt getting a near miss on James. Mike shot in that general area with torpedos and lasers using the force so he wouldn't hit James.
<br>" Bulls eye." Mike said as his laser hit first and following after that the torpedos hit destroying the TIE Phantom.
<br>" Hey, Darklink a little help here." Mike said as the TIE fighter tryed again and missed.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>

"Got it." Sommersaulting over Mike's X-Wing James gets behind the TIE, blasting it away using quad lasers, he takes down the TIE then goes after a couple of Bombers heading towards an Alliance Star Destroyer.

"A you quys wouldn't happen to need any help would yall?" Liedan said tracking a bleep on his radar.
<br>
<br>"My god these thing are impossible to kill." He complained blasting into what seemed like empty space. As he did though he grazed somthing causing sparks and metal to poor out of know where.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Liedan Aish</p>
<p class="text">
"Yep just form up and watch out for TIEs."
<br>When Mike this a group of TIE interceptors broke their ranks. Also Mike sensed a TIE phantom tring to get a lucky shot on him. But Mike did a barrel rollingto dodge the laser bolts for the TIE phantom.

"Scorch your with me, the rest of you attempt to destroy the Bombers. Scorch, you and I are going to form up with Commander Skywaler, we're gonna take down some phantoms." The two X-Wings join up with Mike's group, "Hey, we're gonna take down that Victory thats spurting out phantoms?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>

<p class="text">
"Oh..I knew that." Taking down a TIE Interceptor, "Well shouldn't we start our assult on the SSDs?" After finishing his message he takes a heavy hit on his upper-left wing. "Agh! I've been hit, took out my flight control. I'm a sitting duck until Crome gets it fixed!"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Its sucide to attack the SSDs right now...hold on I'll cover you."
<br>Mike said as he turn his X-Wing around after hearing James saying he was hit. He formed up next to James see that he was having trouble getting the X-Wing standy.
<br>" Darklink, land now while you still have the fighter in one piece. I'll still cover you."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Hold tight you've got a TIE advanced on you're tial." Liedan yelled Locking on to it then launching a torrent of Laser fire at it and causing the small fighter to burst into flame and shrapnel.

Seeing that Crome fixed his flight control James responds, "Got it, thanks guys." Turning around the X-Wing seems to limp towards the Predator to receive repairs.

" Your welcome."
<br>Mike turn the X-Wing around and return to the battle and blast some more eyeballs to space dust. At the same time watching and sensing where the Phantoms are at.

Mike sensed something through the force and barrel roll his X-Wing into a 180 degrees right turn. Just in time for him to see two green laser bolt hitting nothing but space vaccum.
<br>" Thanks Oburn."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>

<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Liedan Aish</p>
<p class="text">
" what is that Lieutenant." as Mike replied to Oburn. He felt something from the lieutenant. After this campainis over; I should bring this up with the Jedi Council about this lieutenant Mike thought as he was blasting a TIE. Mike also started to feel something bad was about to happen.

"I dont know. Just something in the back of my head. It just feel to easy, and know it feels like thers something coming something big." Liedan replied.

<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Liedan Aish</p>
<p class="text">
"Ok, Lieutenant."
<br>Mike looked down at his data screen to check on the status of the Auric Squadron. Some where either in the land bay get some repairs done  or they where still in a hot dogfight with a eyeball or anyother TIE fighter. After he got done looking at the status he had a eyeball on his tail. " Damnit here we go again " Mike said inside his cockpit as he did another 180 degree turn. So he can lose the TIE that was on his tail.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Need some help?" James and his three wingmen fly in and destory the tailing TIE on Mike. "So, what I miss?"

<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>

Mike turned the X-Wing to head back to the Predator so he can rearm and refuel. Because almost everything was down to zero and after the 180 degree turn he spent his last missile on a dumb. When he came out the turn and losing the TIE that was on his tail at the sametime.
<br>" Predator this is Commander Skywaler permission to land and rearm. So I can head back into battle."

" Whitewolf if you can see.We are in a middle of a battle and right now we have to take care of this Remenat Fleet." Mike replied and sending data to him about the ships.Along with the     information about the TIE phantoms and the two SSDs that have a cloaking device on them.
<br>" Here you go whitewolf.... Watch it you have a eyeball on your tail."
<br>Mike turn his X-Wing around so he can engage the TIE that was behind Whitewolf.Trying to get a target lock but the TIE won't stay still.

Flying out of nowhere James blasts away the TIE Fighter. "Boy, after this I better be promoted." He says chuckling, regrouping with the rest of his flight group. "I'm not reading any more eyeballs, but a couple of Bombers, Avengers escorting the bombers and a squad of Defenders, just sitting near one of the SSDs, can't get any reading on TIE Phantoms once they cloak, from what I've seen is that about ten squads are out. Just by reading them from the hangar."
<br>
<br>Heading towards the Promeatheus, James and his flightgroup go in to stop a squad of bombers about to launch Heavy Rockets. "Hotshot, I'm also reading a couple of bombers about to launch Space Bombs into the Zentar. See if you can take em out."

The cathedral was a gigantic room in the center of the Prometheus. Basically the room was filled with one large holodisplay with a strategical map of the battle. On the sides were galleries with almost hundrets of radar opperators and communications officers in front of transperant displays showing their section of the battle. The Room had two smaaler side rooms, similar to this, showing other aspects of the galaxy. Grand Admiral Simon with maybe two dozend other Fallen officers and admirals were standing in the middle of the room walking through the holographic display analysing all details of the battle.
<br>
<br>"Looks like the major bomber contingents of the opponent are down." Michael noticed.
<br>
<br>"Indeed the opponent only has reserve contingents remaining, less then 10% of the original contingent." one of the admirals standing near the Michael was repliing.
<br>
<br>"Excellent, as long as we keep more fighters on the battleground then the Remnants these bombers shouldn't be a tread to us. Much faster then expected. How many bombers we have remaining?"
<br>
<br>"72% of our bomber fleet still opperational."
<br>
<br>A communication officer walked to Michael. "Admiral, Admiral Angelus requests to use some of our bomber contingents to weaken the capitol ships of the opponent, now the opponent bombers are down."
<br>
<br>Michael was taking a look at the tactical display. "Ok, send to the Admiral that he can withdraw the B-Wings and some of the  X-Wing contingents from the Payback, Predator and Warspite, to reequip them with Torpedos, but they should concentrate fire on the ISD leading the formation."
<br>
<br>The communications officer was about to leave. "Ah and give a command to the fleet, the Y-Wings and TIE Bombers should be withdranw and equipped with Torpedos as well, but kept in reserve till we have solved that TIE Phantom problem."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Hearing a message over his comm system James tells his flight group, "Alright boys, just got orders from the higher-ups. They want us to go back to the Predator and load up some torpedos and attack the leading ISD. I think Auric Squadron can handle that, Hotshot, did you get the same orders?" James asks this as he flies in formation with Flight Group III.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Here the message form the communication officer on the Promeatheus. The message was some orders from the Grand Admiral ordering the fleets X-Wing and B-Wings  to head back to their ships. So they can regroup and rearmed them with Torpedos instand of missiles. The order also called for them to return to battle and break the ISD formation.
<br>" Yes, Darklink I got the orders... Auric Squadron form up and land on the Predator. So you can be rearmed with proton torpedos. After you get your torpedos head back out and start attacking the ISDs formation. "
</p>

After stocking up on torpedos, Flight Group III joined in the attack against the Star Destroyer leading the formation. "Lets take down a Star Destroyer. We've done it before in the simulators without problem, we can do it in real life too!" The four X-Wings fly at the crusier. "Scorch your with me, Ace and Straightshot take the dome on the left, me and Scorch will take the dome on the right. Unload all your torpedos into the domes then fly back home to restock, then we'll go after the power generator." 
<br>
<br>This plan was activated several times in the simulator programs James had made for his flight group. Usually the sheild domes would be destroyed and then they could concentrate on the Power Generator. This time though, they had to let the other flight groups have some fun, so they'll just concentrate on the Sheild domes.
<br>
<br>The four X-Wings fly in towards the ISD blasting away the defending TIE Fighters that were launching from the hanger bay, "Mike after we take down the generators, see if you can take down the hanger bay to get these eyeballs off of us." Getting through the first defense screen of fighters the Star Destroyer is now closer. "Laundry cycle!" Suddenly the X-Wings started to barrel roll as if they were gears. The X-Wings break off and head after the shield domes. Stopping their rotation, two X-Wings launch 12 torpedos into the lower portion of the sheild generator, same with the other two. 
<br>
<br>"Whoo! The Star Destroyer's sheilds are down, we also caused some collateral damage to the bridge, the rest of it is yours!" James says this on a general comm channel to all Republic fighters. Flight Group III form back up and head towards the Predator to reload.

" Darklink I'm already that on."
<br>The four X-Wings from Mike's flight group blasted some eyeballs that were in their way. After they did that and got throught the fighter screen from the ISD. The Star Destroyer was giving them some heavy Point-Defense fire.
<br>" Auric flight group two on my mark. lunch four proton missile into the main hanger bay...one...two..Now."
<br>All four X-Wing lunched their missile all at the sametime into the main hanger bay. Blast destroyed anything that was in the hanger bay at the time. When the proton missile exploded inside the main hanger bay.
<br>"Haaaaaa.That ISD will not lunch or recover her fighters." Mike said into the general comm channel to all Republic fighters and ships.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Fully restocked Flight Group III flies towards the ISD in formation, "Sorry Hotshot, I guess I'm getting ahead of myself..didn't mean to give a higher up orders." He says with true apologies in his tone. Heading towards the ISD Auric IIIs plan on destroying most of the point defense turrents.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Don't a problem...Take your flight group and take care of the point defense and after that help take care of the eninges." Mike told Darklink over the squad com channel.
Mike brought the X-Wing around and under the Star Destroyer to get a lock on a eyeball that shot at him earler. When he was doing his attack run on the ISD main hanger bay. Your not going no were Mike thought as the crossheir lined up and Mike pulled the trigger blasting the TIE to space dust.

"We're going in Hotshot. Scorch, Strightshot go for the left side me and Ace will grab the right." The four X-Wings split and they begin to pound the point-defense turrents with proton torpedos. The turrents rip from the hull of the Star Destroyer leaving, what look like scars ontop of the Star Destroyer. The vaccum of space pull in a variety of stormtroopers and imperial officers. "Woot! Scorch, SS how y'all doin?"
<br>
<br>"We're doing fine we took down about three turrents, we're making another run to get the ones on the bottom."
<br>
<br>"Alright, be careful. Ace lets follow suit." The two X-Wings dive under the Destroyer and begin to dodge the laser burst that are flying out of the cannons. Seeing a B-Wing doing the same thing, one of the cannons disenergrate the poor ship and it's pilot. "Damn, be careful leveryone, those cannons can whipe you out in a second!"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Copy that Darklink." 
<br>The four X-Wings of Mike's flight group dive right under the underside of the Star Destroyer. When they got there they watched a B-Wing getting blown to space dust.
<br>
<br>" Darklink my flight group will cover you and we take care of the TIEs. Your objective right now is those point defense guns.....Flight Group II cover flight group III and watch it  Kim you have a ghost on your tail."
<br>
<br>" I can't shake him.......He's all over me.......Where is he can't see him...NO."
<br>
<br>As Mike brought the X-Wing in and right behind the ghost that was behind Auric 4-2. Damnit Mike thought as he pulled the trigger in a quad brusts and destroying the TIE phantom. But it was to late when Mike destroyed the TIE and he just lost his wingman.

While the fighters and bombers of both sides were fighting in the spaces between the warships, these were meanwhile spread pretty much over the battlefield. The Remnants had tried to move their SSDs more into battle covering the damaged ISD, the 5th fleet had splitted formation, tried to encycle the opponent but changed plan and moved closer to the opponents to break the opponents formation. The Remnant VSDs were falling back and some Rebel ships tried to encounter them while others blocked the SSDs. At the end all ships were more or less in melee positions all over the area.

Liedan swooped threw the ship reckages blasting away another TEI, completly ablivios to what happend to the rest of his squadron.

<br>
<br>"Are they retreating?" Liedan questioned over the comlink.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Liedan Aish</p>
<p class="text">
"No, I think they're changing formation to compensate losses, they still have the upper hand here. With their Phantoms and two SSDs they have us outgunned." Flying out of the Predator his flight group notices their Destroyer they were attacking is now blocked by one of the SSDs. "There's no way we could disable a SSD by ourselves.."

<br>Mike didn't see it coming before it was to late. Now has Mike fights to keep the X-Wing in stright line and trun it around to head back to the Predator.
<br>" Damnit, I'm losing power in that same area."
<br>Mike looked over and see that there was no engine there at all.
<br>
<br>" Predator come in, I need to land now I'm losing power and I lost my top starboard engine."
<br>F*ck Mike thought as he tryed to keep her from crashing into a Republican TIE fighter. That just flown right passed him and few feet from his X-Wing.

"Good god, I knew it. We're outnumbered and outgunned." James thought to himself, "Hold on Hotshot I'll cover you while Scorch gets some help." Hovering around Mike's damaged X-Wing James begins to destroy any enemy fighter that tries to attack Mike's ship. "It's been a while since I've been attacked by a phantom..that's strange"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Liedan made a sharp dive near a piece of a destroyed fighter, both TIEs followed him one crashing on the busted fighter the other just barely making it. 
<br>
<br>'All rite you can do this.' Liedan asure himself 'he's not that good'. Liedan thought spinning his X-wing knocking a piece of wreckage at the TIE. 
<br>
<br>The TIE quickly dodged it and fired it lasers at Liedan In retaliation. 
<br>Seeing the Warspite near him Liedan took the opportunity to fly directly at the ship dodging it lasers. The TIE was in hot pursuit, just as Liedan had planned. The Warspites mighty torrents overwhelmed and enveloped the tine TEI in a show of greens and reds, while Liedan quickly broke off and rejoined the battle.

" Thanks Darklink.."
<br> As they fly towords their carrier ship so Mike can land and so Mike can get some repairs done to his X-Wing.'Something not right at all' Mike thought when he felt something through the force.
<br>
<br>" James watch out....There is a Ghost coming right at you." 
<br>
<br>That what Mike felt through the force and he brought his X-Wing and block the laser shot from the Ghost. Mike took a direct hit in the top starboard wing and Mike ejected when this happen.

<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Damn!" Looking around for the phantom he see's Mike's body floating in space. Calling the Predator for a recovery team he sees that the ejection system of the X-Wing released a sort of steam that revealed a bit of the Phantom. Going in for pursuit, James takes his X-Wing and blasts the fighter away. "Alright Hotshot, don't worry I've called a recovery team. Hang tight." This is said over Mike's personal commlink in his helmet.

<p class="text">
As Mike float there in space and watch the battle happaing all around him. What can I do to help as I float here..I know let see if this works Mike thought as he uses the force to push debris way from him. So it wouldn't hit him while he waits for the shuttle to pick him up. As he let the force flow through him. Mike was going to use the force to see where the Ghosts are before they attack a Republican pilot. So after he knows where they are Mike going to use his personal commlink in his helmet let his pilots or other Fifth fleet pilots know they have a Ghost on their tail.

"Yeah I think so, my R2 unit is picking up his signature." Seeing a TIE Fighter squad flying at him, he tells his flight group members to split and go one-on-one. Destroying the squad he asks Predator command, "What now?"

Liedan looked around. 
<br>
<br>"Jolt you got a lock on skywaler yet." Liedan questioned his R-4 unit.
<br>
<br>It made a few peeps and clicks then replied "Yes his a little deeper into the debris field to your port side."
<br>
<br>"How can he survive in this." Liedan questioned.

Letting the force flow through him Mike saw a Ghosts coming right at Ensign Ory. Using his headset Mike contacted both James to let him know about the TIE Phantom.
<br>
<br>" James theres a Ghost a few clicks away and he is about to fire his laser...so move right about now. "

"Jolt use a nother sonar blast I dont want any ghost sneeking up on us." Liedan orderd the droid. 
<br>Looking up from his controls Liedan noticed a small distortion in the Light and back ground seemingly following James. Liedan quickly shot two short burst of lasers twards it.

Seeing a mixture of red and green light, James has a shocked look on his face. Seeing the green bursts of energy pound into his rear deflectors, he glances over at the readout infront of him, showing the back shields are bearly there after the attack. After making an evasive manuver, that was ordered by Hotshot, he's hit again. But not by a phantom but by O'Burn's shot which destroyed the phantom behind him. Unfortunetly, the shots took out his rear deflectors and damaged the top right engine. 
<br>
<br>"Chrome, see if you can get that engine shut down before it explodes and takes more off of this ship!" His R2 unit responded by messing around with the internal circuitry in the X-Wing's complex systems. Finally, James felt a jolt, giving him the sign that his R2 unit succeeded in shutting down the engine. Now his X-Wing's moving as slow as a Y-Wing at top speed.

After shuttle Triage finally made it to Mike and picked him up. "Shit we have two squints coming this way " the pilot of Triage said to his co-pilot after he brought Mike onboard.
<br>
<br>" Is there any pilots whiling to escort us back to the Predator. We have two squints heading this way." the shuttle pilot said in the com channel.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"I got ya Hotshot. Besides I needed an excuse to go back to the Predator for repairs anyways. I'm basically a sitting duck for the imps with a damaged engine. But I'll still be able to do point defense." Trailing behind the Triage, James orders his flight group to give him some cover and take down the interceptors.

High Admiral Angelus were standing on the bridge of the Superstardestroyer Angel of Death while the ship was slowly drifting through the corridor between the two Remnant Victory Class Stardestroyers on the former left flank. Both Remant stardestroyers had been heavyly damaged. A few of the laser batteries were still fireing on the Angel, while the SSD was shooting back with every laser turret in target range.
<br>
<br>On the left side two corvettes escorting the Zentar were shooting on two assault transports and a TIE Fighter closing the position of the Zentar. The Warspite followed pretty close behind the Zentar. On the right side some smaller Remnant ships were withdrawing towards the position of the remaining Remnant fleet when the Predator got closer.
<br>
<br>The four carriers together with more then a dozend smaller escort ships and a couple of fighters moving along them were moving towards the position of the Remnant Superstardestroyers.
<br>
<br>Angelus ordered to one of his communication officers to give out the order to start the Y-Wing reserves to weaken the shields of the two Black Dagger Legion Superstardestroyers.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Meanwhile on the other side of the battlefield the three Stardestroyers of Battlegroup One were in close combat with the three Remant Stardestroyers on this side of the battlefield. The Republican battlegroup was slightly better armored then it's opponent and had definitly more fighter and bomber support. But the Remnants fought tougher on this side, maybe cause they beleaved they could win the battle here. The Remnants SSDs were just two weapon ranges away from Battlegroup One. Their movemt towards the other Remnant stardestroyers could maybe turn the battle there, but there were a lot of Republican ID codes on their scanners moving towards their position from the other side of the battleground.
<br>
<br>Michael was standing on the bridge of the Prometheus meanwhile. The staffs were continuing to analyse the movements in the cathedral, but while the Prometheus was rotating the front towards the central region of this battle fireing with all cannons the ship had, Michael had a good overview on the battle from the bridge as well, now the tactical constallation had become easier.
<br>
<br>Their movement was still ineffective, they would loose the battle, Michael thought, before he realised the Remnants are forming up to retreat from the battle. The Remnants went outnumbered into this battle, they could have waited for more reinforcements before they attack. Sure, their stealth technology have often given them a big advantages in battles. Well, this surely wasn't the command style of Horus, maybe one of his admirals has more or less acted on his own, or had the authority to opperate here. Michael was pretty sure that the future would answer some of these questions and he started to concentrate on the battle again. Priority was now to push the opponent off the system without too many more losses. They would need every soldier for the progress of the campaign.

Liedan maneuvered threw the battle field avoiding gun fire and shrapnel from the destroyed ships. 
<br>
<br>"We need to figure out how to take down those Supers." Liedan said over the com link to any one that may be listening.

After escorting Shuttle Triage and getting his engine repaired, James flies out of the Predator's hangar bay to hear Lieden's message over the commlink. "O'Burn, it's exactly like taking down a Star Destroyer, only it's bigger. High Admiral Angleous, requesting permission to join the Y-Wing squadrons in their attack against those Super Star Destroyers, my flight group and I are fully stocked on Proton Torpedos."
</p>

Liedan Picked up his comlink "Lieutenant comander Liedan AIsh also requesting permition to join the Y-wing."

After getting off the shuttle Mike went to the infermary. So he can be checked out by the doctor before he went back out an join the battle again. Spending a few mintues in the infermary the cleared Mike for be fit for duty.So Mike left the infermary to head back to the hanger bay. My X-Wing is gone I wonder if they have any reserved fighter I can use Mike thought as he open up his comlink.
<br>
<br>" Commander Skywaler to Bridge, Do we have any reserved fighters I can use,so I can return to the battle."

Getting the confermation, James orders his flight group to form up on the Y-Wing squads. Flying at high speeds towards one of the bridges of the SSDs. The four X-Wings launch proton torpedos at both sheild domes. "I hope this works.." One dome explodes, spurting shrapnel and flames from the dome. The second dome has a giant breach in it, and now the shield dome is leaking a strange liquid, probably the material that powers the shields.
<br>
<br>"One of the Super Star Destroyer's sheilds are down. Y-Wing squadrons, you guys are cleared for attack." James' flight group begins to fly back as he sees a squadron of TIE Phantoms flying out of the 2nd SSD. "Alright guys, lets take out these ghosts before they cloak. Yet, the Phantoms don't cloak, the fighters fly at the X-Wings, outmavuvering them. Now James and his flight group are trapped by TIE Phantoms and the SSD's point defense turrents. "Gah! This is Flight Group III of Auric Squadron, requesting assistance!"
<br>
<br>"Dammit, this was a horrible idea, what have I done?!" This thought rises in James' head as he tries to eliminate the TIE Phantoms without getting blasted by the SSD.

What was left of corvettes and transporters, fighters with hyperspace and other smaller ships moved into hyperspace first
<br>
<br>The Superstardestroyers had slowly rotated into position of their hyperspace jump. Their engines drastically accelerated the ships and they crushed a few smaller fighters of both sides in their movement ahead. A few seconds later both ships had vanished in hyperspace.
<br>
<br>The three remaining smaller stardestroyers of the Remnants tried the same. Through their damages and the close position to the Republican stardestroyers it took a few moments longer to move them into position. All three ships tried to accellerate to make the hyperspace jump. Two of the stardestroyers managed to escape, but the ISD with the former front position or the Remnant formation was damaged to seriously. When triing to accellerate the reactor overheated to strong. The nuclear reaction got uncontrollable and the ship exploded into thousants of pieces. Many of the smaller parts were glowing when hitting the shileds of the Republican stardestroyes neighbouring the ships; luckyly the larger parts missed those ships.
<br>
<br>The few fighters of the Imperial Remants that had survived the battle and without hyperspace were falling back to the planet.
<br>
<br>The wrecks of the two VSDs had been evacuated already. They were only drifting through space with large holes all over the hull. Bridge, engines, reactors had been changed into space trash drifting all over the battleground.
<br>
<br>Wing Commanders started to call back their pilots. Shuttles and transports were send out to recover those people drifting through space in damaged ships or space suits.

"Hmm..the Star Destroyer's upped and left..guess we won." "All fighters, report back to the Predator for debreifing" The voice of Rear Admiral Gustafsson echoes throughout the comm systems of the Predator squads. "Alright, lets head back to the Predator." The four, damaged, X-Wings make their way back home.

In the hanger bay Mike watch the Predator's squads come in for a landing. Which has done lots of times. The final squad to land in the hanger bay was Auric Squadron. Mike walked over Ensign Ory the flight leader of Group III.
<br>
<br>" So, What did I miss after I was picked up. " Mike asked the Ensign.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"So thats it they just up and leave. Well that was one hell of a date. Dont come back asking fore a second." Liedan said chuckling
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Liedan Aish</p>
<p class="text">
Hopping out of the X-Wing, James removes his helmet and answers Hotshot's question. "Not much, my flight group was going to try and take down a SSD but they turned around and retreated..that's pretty much it."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Ok, lets brief what just happen and go over the battle details. " Mike said to Esign Ory
<br>
<br>With that said all members of Auric squadron lefted the hanger bay. So they can head off towords the pilots briefing room and go over the details of the battle. Then after they were done with the breifing about the they were .Afterword they all left the briefing to their quarters to get some rest. They all need it after the long and hard fought battle with Warlord Hours Fleet.

'Well thats over.' Liedan thought getting out of his X-wing. 'but whats next.'
