<b>What is the Naval Headquater (NHQ)?</b>
<br>The NHQ is the central command of the Imperial navy of the old empire. Since the old republic all regular fleets have been commanded by the NHQ. Actually only a few remnants of the Imperial forces are still under central command. Since the Imperial government has been eliminated, some of the governors and territorial lords of the old empire support the Imperial superterritorial navy with some older equipment and a few recruits, even when they use most of their resources for thier own militia units. A lot of bigger cooperations support the Imperial navy as well, even when it is cheaper to pay own security services, but as a sort of thradition they still support the navy. The NHQ itself is only the military arm of the former Imperial government, so it don't has own territory. 
<br>
<br><b>What is the 5th fleet?</b>
<br>The 5th fleet is on of the the regulars fleet of the NHQ and it's actually with one third fleet strengh the biggest fleet in the NHQ. The 5th was a support fleet before the batlle Yarvin VI, but then the emperor sent more and more of his regular fleet out in the Outer Rim to hunt for the Rebels. The 5th was one of theese fleets. The actual fleet commander, Grand Admiral Simon, got his command very late after a short career in the NHQ. The 5th has returned to the Galactic Core to defend the last of the core 
<br>worlds. 
<br>
<br><b>The late history of the NHQ:</b>
<br>Count Donaarn managed it to destroy the smash the old NHQ some time ago and the few remaining naval fleets went different ways. After a conference of several of the remaining governors, the secret council, some cooperations and other important persons of the empire in the core regions made Grand Admiral Michael Simon to the new Chairman of the NHQ with the order to establish the NHQ again. Some of the regular fleet followed the new NHQ, like the 1st Fleet under the command of Admiral Jerec and the 3rd fleet under the command of Fleet Admiral Jjerrows, later the 6th fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Tav1 and the 13th fleet under the command of Grand Admiral Daemon, but between the fronts of the different Imperial warlords, the rebels, the pitates and other fractions, the NHQ lost most of its troops. 
</p>

<h1>Imperial Military Organisation<a name="mark2">&nbsp;</a></h1>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>The Imperial Forces:</b>
<br>The official Imperial troops are devided into four independent units: The army, the sector navy, the superterritorial navy and the planetary defense forces or militia. A council of the 12 Grand Admirals has command about all theese units. Only the secret order of the emperor and familiar oganizations have military groups not commanded by this council. 
</p>

<center><img src="ia_itac1.gif"></center>

<p class="textwhite">
The Army has the most personal and material. The sector gouvernor has the control about the complete sector based army. The greatest part of the Army is planetary based because their main order is to defend the Imperial sectors. 
<br>
<br>The sector navy is the biggest Imperial military force. (Several thousants KDY Stardestroyers Imperium-Class before the battle near Endor) Every sector has usually between 10 and 60 Imperial fleets (equal strengh as a Battlegroup in the Navy) which are concerning of several Stardestroyes plus medium capital ships, escort ships and freighters. 
<br>
<br>The superterritorial Navy is the smalest part of the Imperial forces. Usually there are 20 regular fleets in the navy, which consists of battlegroups (fleet- and carrier-groups). The Minister of Offense commands the navy, the naval directorate, a council of four directors, one for the security, one for the marine corps and two for the navy, assists the minister. The function of the navy is to attack exterrior enemies of the empire, that's why the navy has the best equipment and the most elite units. 
</p>

<center><img src="ia_itac2.gif"></center>

<p class="textwhite">
<br>Planetary governments and Imperial lords have often own military units called the Imperial Planetary Defense Forces or militia. These units are absolutly different from each other, some planets have not more than a squadron, some lords have more military units than the sector gouvernor of the sector has. 
<br>
<br>Royal Guard, Secret Order and Secret Council units are the biggest parts of the Imperial forces, which don't follow the orders of the council of the Grand Admirals. Usually the empire uses them for inooficial missions. 
<br>It's easy to recognize a member of the royal guard because of the red uniform he wears. Only members of the royal guard are allowd to wear this uniforms, and its really a special honor to wear it, because more than 90 percent of the soldiers in there are genetic optimized or cloned. The whole Royal Guard consists of 4 divisions. 
<br>The Secret Order army consists of 20 divisions and around 50 medium capital ships. They usually don't fight against non-Imperial units, their order is to eliminate traitorious or inefficient parts of navy, army and militia. 
<br>The Secret Council only has two divisions, because it usually uses the military police and security officers for the missions. The most important aim of the Secret Council is to watch and control the actions of the Secret Order.

<h1>Ground Forces Codex<a name="mark4">&nbsp;</a></h1>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Introduction</b> 
<br>Actually the Imperial Ground Forces as well as all other parts of the empire are diveded into two groups with different Ideologies. Usually most part of the untis directly commanded by the emperor beleave in the dark side of the force and in the total supperiority of the emperor and the sith order. The Stormtrooper devisions are the best examples for this kind of units. 
<br>The Imperial infantry and the rest of the Imperial navy fill the lines of the other group. They usually don't like "religious groups" like the Jedi Knights and the Dark Jedi, but they beleave in the human superiority and in the federation. The old republic as well as the empire are sometimes called federation in case you mean both governments. 
<br>These groups usually don't like each other and sometimes they are fighting against each other. The emperor was able to control both partys and so he was able to gain control of the galaxy, but the emperor is dead. 
<br>
<br><b>Imperial Infantry Units</b> 
<br><img src="ia_codx1.gif" align="right">The difference between the is shown by their equipment. Usually the Imperial Army and the Imperial Militia have many more different kinds of Imfantry units, than the few, mentioned here. But the Imperial Marine Corps are ship based infantry units, and so several the other unit types, not metioned here, are inefficient or not even possible to transport by ship. Most of the weapons in the Imperial Infantry are older because of the low support for all Imperial units. 
<br>Imperial Infantry soldiers are usually loyal to their direct military leaders and don't like it, to work together with units of other Imperial fractions or with Sith or Dark Jedi units. 
<br>
<br><b>Imperial light Infantry</b> 
<br>The Imperial light infantry is the most used unit type in ground combats. The light Infantry consists of a great number of unamored soldiers with riffles and a few heavy weapons. The typical weapon for the ILI is the projectile storm rifle, usually equiped with armor breaking, explosive or light bio-toxic amunition. Usually the soldiers of the ILI are wearing uniform coats and helmets as armor, a few of them wear breast plates and high officers of the ground forces have personal deflector shields. 
<br>
<br><b>Imperial heavy Infantry</b> 
<br>The Imperial heavy infantry is nor really an infantry. Its a mix of a tank unit and a mobile artellary. The IHI consists of heavy storm-tanks, anti air/ground tanks, mobile artillary vehicles, as well as soldiers with light and heavy weapons and exoscelet armors some war droids. The Imperial heavy Infantry as well as the Imperial mobile Infantry consist of soldiers, which have served in the Imperial light Infantry for some time. 
<br>
<br><b>Imperial mobile Infantry</b>
<br>The Imperial mobile Imfantry is equiped like the Imperial light infantry, but the use walkers, speeder bikes and land speeders in fights. Soldiers with experiance in the ILI can be transferred to the IMI 
<br>
<br><b>Elite Ground Forces</b>
<br>Most is classified about the Elite Units. They are usually not using vehicles, but they have the best support in weapons, armors and amunition in the empire. 
<br>
<br><b>Stormtroopers and special Stormtrooper units</b>
<br><img src="ia_codx2.gif" align="left">Stormtroopers are indoctrinated to serve the emperor or the Dark Lords, even those, who have been enlisted after endor. Stormtroopers are eqipped with a light body armor and different kinds of blaster weapons. Actually most of the Stormtrooper devisions have been destroyed in the wars against the Alliance, but a few Stormtrooper units survived. After the death of the emperor some very religious elite units build some special Orders. 
<br>
<br><b>Dark Trooper Units</b> 
<br>Once the Dark Trooper unit was the most dangerous ground forces unit of the empire, but only a few dark trooper armors and dark trooper droids left and the production capabilities for these armors have been destroyed. So most of the dark trooper units use black painted exoscelleton armors (Familiar to the armors of the Heavy Stormtrooper units) or just black stormtrooper armors. 
<br>
<br><b>Heavy Stormtrooper Units</b>
<br>The Heavy Stormtrooper units consists of elite Stormtroopers in exoscelett-armors. The exoscelett armor is a huge titan plate armor. A human is not able to carry such an armor, so this armor uses an own titan scelett with huge motors to control the movement. Sensors in legs, arms and in the helmet control the movement of the armor. They scan the neural lines inside of the soldiers body and move, when the real leg moves. Heavy stormtroopers can't move as fast as normal Stormtroopers or soldiers in Dark Trooper suits. Heavy stormtrooper armors are painted in white and black. 
<br>
<br><b>Order of Darkness</b>
<br>The Order of Darkness is a religios Organisation. A very good soldier of the stormtrooper units can be asigned to the Order of Darkness platoons. The Order is led by the Prefect of Darkness, but the Order units are asigned to the normal divisions. They follow the commands of their Imperial Commanders as well as the orders of their Prefect. Soldiers of the Order of Darkness have implanted neural interfaces, so they can direct control their Heavy Stormtrooper Armors and because of this their reactions are faster as the reactions of their Heavy Stormtooper comrads. 
<br>
<br><b>The Royal Guard</b>
<br>The Royal Guard has been the highest elite unit of the empire, but it has been estinguished. These units have been destroyer, but there are still a couple survivors of the Royal Guard in other Imperial Units. 
</p>

<h1>Uniform Manual<a name="mark5">&nbsp;</a></h1>

<img src="ia_unim1.gif" align="left">
<p class="textwhite">
<b>Medals</b> 
<br>Usually all merits on the standart uniform are displayed as patches above the ranking emblem. 3 to 5 patches will be added to one line before you can start another line. If you have 5 lines, you can add more than 5 patches to one line. New lines are started above the older lines. (Some older Imperial medals are usually worn as full medals on the standart uniform, but actually the Imperial navy don't uses these medals) 
<br>
<br><b>Unit Symbols, Special Unit Symbols</b>
<br>Unit Symbols are worn below the ranking emblem, Special Unit Symbols below the Unit Symbols. 
<br>
<br><b>Code Cylinders</b> 
<br>Usually the Imperial navy uses two kinds of cylinders. (short silver cylinders have been phased out since 25 NE) Silver cylinders mark you line position, red cylinders your special position. Silver Cylinders are ever closer to the ranking badge, than red cylinders. Red cylinders are ever on the same site with the ranking emblem. The cylinders only show your active position. If your position changes, you have to wear other cylinders. 
<br>
<br><b>Service Ribbons</b> 
<br>The Imperial forces actually wear three different types of ribbons: 
<br>
<br><b>The Ribbon of Nobility</b> 
<br>The Ribbon of nobility is a golden ribbon on a golden star and is usually worn by planetary monachs. You must have the title of baron to be allowd to wear such this ribbon. 
</p>

<table border="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0" width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="ia_unim2.gif"></td><td align="center"><img src="ia_unim3.gif"></tr></td></table>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>The Adjutants Ribbon</b>  
<br><i>(Left Picture)</i> The Adjutants Ribbon looks familiar to the Ribbon of Nobility, only the colors are different. This ribbon is blue and yellow with a green star. Usually adjutants wear such a ribbon, or officers, who have been adjutant. Not like the cylinders, you can keep your adjutant ribbon, even if you aren't adjutant anymore.  
<br>
<br><b>The Line Ribbon</b>
<br><i>(Right Picture)</i> The line ribbon is usually awardent to supreme line commanders like Fleet Commander. The ribbon has the colors light blue and dark blue. In former times this ribbon have been awarded to ground commanders so that soldiers can easyly gecognize their leaders in ground combats. Actually the ribbon is only given as special honor to some officers. Like the Adjutants Ribbon, officers are allowed to war this ribbon, even when they got another position.  
<br>
<br><i>Note: officers can wear the other ribbons as soon as they reached the requirements, but Line Ribbons have to be given by the government or the central high command.</i>
</p>

<p class="textwhite">
<br><b>Uniform Colors</b> 
<br>More than 70 percent of the Imperial forces wear grey uniformes. The army uses sometimes different grey tones like grey-green, grey-violett or grey-brown, but this havn't a meaning like the other uniform colors: 
<br><b>Grey uniform:</b> The usual Imperial officer/soldier

<br>
<br><b>Badge form</b> 
<br>Usually the number of the squares shows the ranking (Some parts of the army have a different rules for the number of squares, not displayed here): 1 square: Flight Cadet/Cadet 2 squares: Ensign/second Lieutenant (Army) 
<br>3 squares: Second Lieutenant/first Lieutenant (Army)
<br>4 squares: First Lieutenant/Captain (Army) 
<br>5 squares: Lieutenant Commander/Major
<br>6 squares: Commander/Lieutenant Colonel 
<br>[7 squares: Senior Commander/Senior Lieutenant Colonel]
<br>8 squares: Captain/Colonel 
<br>10 squares: Comodore to Admiral/Brigadier General to General
<br>12 squares: Fleet Admiral to Grand Admiral 
<br>In the navy every second square is added in the second line, the IIS fills the first line with 6 squares, before they start with the second line. Parts of the army uses the navy system in this point, some parts, the IIS system. In case there are more squares in the second line than in the first line, the squares in the second line will be placed in the middle of the second line. Navy officers add sometimes more than 6 squares to one line. Examples:

<b>Square Colors:</b>
<br>The square colors of a ranking badge usually don't change, exept this officer gets more squares with a promotion. In a promotion, usually two sqares will be added. The position you have or the position you get with the promotion decides, which color the squares have: 
<br>Usual Asignments:
<br>-Officers working in the navy or the army get one red and one blue square. 
<br>-Officers working in the IIS gets two red squares. 
<br>-Officers working in the navy/army central high command or the government get one yellow and one blue square. 
<br>-Officers working in the IIS central high command get one yellow and one yellow and one red square. 
<br>-Officers working for the militia or the planetary police get two blue squares. 
<br>Special Asignments:
<br>-Officers working for the Imperial Secret Council or a familiar projekt get one orange square and one blue square. 
<br>-Officers working for the Imperial Secret Council or a familiar projekt in covered missions get one orang square and one red square. 
<br>-Officers working in high advisor positions in the fedaral government get two yellow squares. 
<br>-Civil Officers working for the Imperial forces get one blue and one green square. (For example doctors) 
<br>Example:
<br>Colonel Mustermann from the Marine Corps (The Marine Corps is a part of the Imperial navy) is actually serving in a usual position. He has actually 4 red squares and 4 blue squares. He gets promoted to Brigadier General, so get gets one red square and one blue square more. In case Colonel Mustermann had been transfered to the navy high command before the promotion or with the promotion, he would get one yellow square and one blue square.

<b>Halfsteps</b>
<br>Since 28 NE the empire uses Halfsteps, that means for some promotions you only get one square. In the navy and in the IIS the halfstep square is ever red, even if the officer, who gets promoted, is asigned in the navy high command. Halfstep rankings are: Cadet, second Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander and [Senior Commander]. Line Captain is a half step ranking too, but actually the ranking isn't used in the navy. The Halfstep square will be deleted with a promotion to a fullstep ranking. Halfstep squares in the militia are usually blue, in the army halfstep squares can have different colores. 
<br>Example:
<br>First Lieutenant Mustermann is serving as adjutant in the navy central high command. He has actually 2 yellow squares and two blue squares. He will be promoted to the halfstep ranking lieutenant commander, so he gets one red square. Then he will be promoted to Commander. The red square will be deleted and he gets one yellow square and one blue square more.

<b>Color sorting</b>
<br>The squares are sorted from the brightest to the darkest color. Yellow is the brightest, than orange, than red, than blue and green is the darkest color. Some factories produce the green color for the rank signs a bit brighter than the blue color, just ignore this, the colors are sorted for importance and the brightness of the color is only a hint for easyer sorting the squares. Some other units have white, grey, black and violett rank squares, especially parts of the former secret order, but the navy don't use this colors. To sort the colors you begin with the highest line and fill in the brightest (or most important) squares from left to right, then you proceed with the next lower line and so on. 
<br>
<br><b>Admiral/General signs:</b> 
<br>Admiral or General signs are usually added on the collar, sometimes on the right shoulder. There are four different signs, which can be added: the diamond, the half-diamond and the empty versions of both signs.
</p>

<p class="textwhite">
The half-diamon is the same as a star in the U. S. armed forces. The diamond is the same as a cross in the German armed forces.
