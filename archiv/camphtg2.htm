<h1>Hunting the Ghost (Phase Two)</h1>

<p class="text">

<b>Phase II</b>
<br>
<br>High Admiral Horn, High Admiral Angelus and Grand Admiral Simon and a dozen of other Republican officer were in hotel tower in the biggest city on the surface of Ogompak III. In the middle of the room was map of the surface of Ogompak III with markings for each unit on the surface.
<br>
<br>Rear Admiral Gustafsson was entering the room and High Admiral Angelus talked to him.
<br>
<br>"Hello Tax, I have a mission for you. A reconnaissance X-Wing has spied out Fnarit Klirr and Horus fleet has disappeared from there. Maybe they are collecting their forces to attack us here in Ogompak. Well, a good chance for a small strike against Horus defenses on Fnarit Klirr. The inner planets are heavily defended by several platforms and laser turrets on satellites and civil stations and surely by several hundred fighters.
<br>
<br>The outer planets of the system are only defended by the armored docking ring Fnarit Klirr Zeta. Usually there are Stardestroyers docked there, but they aren't there at the moment, just the Dreadnaught Astralbaum covers the station. The station is basically a large ring with heavy armor and a few laser turrets against fighters and ships. It's guarded by 3 squadrons of TIE Avengers. The Dreadnaught has a squadron of TIE Interceptors onboard.
<br>
<br>You will lead a small assault with Carrier Group Predator against the station, you will additionally have two squadrons of X-Wings Orange and Violet, equipped with missiles. The other Carrier Groups need to recover, so this mission is up to you. I need VDJ currently here, so you are leading the Carrier Group in this mission. Just jump there, take out the ring, return here, ... and may the force be with you."
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Some hours later Carrier Group Predator had left hyperspace several kilometers away from the docking ring. the dreadnaught were directly next to the station. Both were starting their fighters. X-Wings of Orange and Violet squadrons left hyperspace some hundred meters in front of the stardestroyer Predator.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Taking Ogompak III had proven to be less of a challenge than Tax had been expecting, good news were that all of his pilots lent our to aid the other carrier groups had made it, they soon reported back onboard the Predator.
<br>
<br>Now it was time for the real action, while the other parts of the fleet rearmed and caught some shut-eye. The Predator had been called out to strike some sort of shipyard or docking ring.
<br>Reconnaissance reported a single Deadnaught and heavy Fighter Support, in counter, the Predator would be reinforced by two additional squadrons of X-Wings, always a welcomed sight.
<br>
<br>The Predator was now located several kilometers away from the station itself, Orange and Violet dropped out of hyperspace a few hundred meters in front of the Predator.
<br>
<br>"Bridge, report"
<br>"Scanners confirm recon scan, single Dreadnaught with some 50 fighters, they're all over the place sir."
<br>"Admiral, our Squadrons are launching, we're 50 TIEs against our 48 X-Wings, 12 A-Wings and of course our bombers if things get out of hands."
<br>"I don't like those odds Commander, count in Deadnaught's laser batteries and the defensive guns on the platform and we're looking at a massacre.
<br>Helm!"["Yes sir?"]"Diagonal course to the Dread, normal speed, form up our squadrons on our clear side and direct shields to our battle side. We're gonna try to lure the TIEs away from the stationary defenses and straight into our fighter's concussion missiles or our laser batteries. Have the squadrons prepared to form a fighter-screen and take them head on though."
<br>"Aye Aye Captain"
<br>
<br>Tax returned to his thoughts, TIE Advanced squadrons was considered Horus' elite. Facing them 1 on 1 could turn nasty very quickly, and without any real advantage, Tax dared not risk it, but hopefully the Fighters would see their advantage and Tax's careful approach and strike without thinking, if it would the the Predator and it's squadrons vs only the TIEs, the battle would be much easier, the only think Tax feared was the anti-fighter batteries on the Dread and station. He decided it was best to let them make the first move, and then act according to their moves.
<br>Tax nodded to himself and looked at the Wing Commander, Tax wanted status on the Squadrons.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
As Mike brought his fighter around from under the belly of the Predator along with his comrades from the sqaudron. His com channel beeped, I wonder what type of orders does the Wing Commander has for me Mike thought as he watches Aruic 2-2 forming on his wing.
<br>"Yes, Commander Skywaler here."
<br>"Commander, form a fighter screen around Predator along with Violet squadron."
<br>"Copy, that bring Auric Squadron around."
<br>Mike dial into the frequency com channel they were using, so he can give out some orders to Auric Squadron.
<br>"Ok boys, this is it form a fighter screen around Predator and get target locks on those TIE Avengers and TIE Interceptors. Lock S-foils into attack position."
<br>Mike's heads up display show him that they understood his orders. As Mike locked his S-foils into attack position and was getting target locks on the lead TIE Avenger. Then Mike got the back on the Preadtor's com channel frequecncy again to inform control they were in position.
<br>"Auric Leader to Control, we are in position and targets are locked in."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
While the Dreadnaught was still defending the station. The TIE Avengers of Delta, Epsilon and Phi squadron and TIE Interceptor squadron Lambda had been deployed. In strict formation they had moved towards the Republican intruders. The Avengers had reduced the speed so the Interceptors could follow them, but when they had reached the middle between Remnant and Republican battleships and were confronted by the Republican fighter squadrons they moved the additional energy into shield systems, cause X-Wings were slower the Avengers, even slower then Interceptors, so they could fight the Republican on Interceptor speed. Just Epsilon squadron, that had focussed the A-Wings moved on full seed again. The Avengers were ready to try to get their opponents into missile lock to hunt them with their advanced concussion missiles while the Interceptors had to fight the opponents with traditional lasers.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile Stormtrooper Transports had started from the armored docking ring. After 5 of the transports with the signature Alpha 1 to Alpha 5 had started, they went into formation with the Dreadnaught and moved towards the Republican Carrier Group as well protected by the Remnant warship.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Tax watched the TIE Avengers and Interceptors clash together with his squadrons, first impact seemed to had gone well and all the fighters were now swirling around dog-fighting each other.
<br>Meanwhile, the Dreadnaught was beginning to close in on the Predator, it was flanked by Assault Transports, most likely carrying boarding-crews.
<br>"Damnit! Alert our soldiers, prepare the ship for being boarded.
<br>They will come through the main hangar so barricade it! Use the concealed hangar for fighter repairs and rearmaments. Launch our Y-Wings, load them with Proton Torpedoes, priority are the Assault Transports.
<br>
<br>Helm! Bring the ship around, shields front and tell the batteries to fire-at-will. Occupy the Dreadnaught and zero-in on the Transports! Look alive people, we're in for a ride, make sure the batteries target the Dread first hand, the Transports' lasers aren't gonna do much damage."
<br>
<br>Tax looked around himself, the crew performed well, they all knew their tasks. As he glanced at the ship's security screen, he saw the different doors turning red, symbolizing that they're closed and under security lock-down. Now the blast-doors for the bridge closed, sealing the bridge-staff in. The holocam projection showed Republican soldiers preparing the main hangar for battle, hopefully the assault transports would be destroyed before coming within range to deploy the stormtroopers but barricading the hangar was a necessary precaution to take.
<br>
<br>Tax now turned to the acting Wing Commander.
<br>"How are our fighters doing Commander, any word from Skywaler and the others?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
Damnit Mike thought as the Imperial TIE fighters engage them and Mike was trying to avoid a TIE Avenger that was on his tail. "Get off of me," Mike was yelling from inside of his cockpit. Mike was doing his best to avoid the laser show from the TIE Avenger. Mike brought his X-Wing closer to the Predator to lose the TIE fighter in the Point-Defense guns on the Predator. When Mike was doing this a well placed shot from one of the Point-Defense gun crews took out the TIE Avenger that was behind him. Before the TIE was destroyed the Imperial pilot took a lucky shot at Mike’s top starboard engine.
<br>"I'm hit, Predator. I need to land that TIE Avenger that was on my tail took out my top starboard engine. Admiral, we have Imperial assault shuttles coming and with your permission can Auric Squadron take out those shuttles before they reach the Predator."

Tax heard Mike's call over the comm.
<br>
<br>"Open up the concealed hangar and ask the technicians to see what they can do." Tax ordered.
<br>
<br>"Auric 2-1, you are clear to land in Hangar B, it should be opening up for you now. Negative on engaging those Assault Transports, we need Auric fighting those TIE squadrons, it's already a close battle as it is. See if you can repair the engine and then get back to those TIEs. Wing Commander out." Was the acting Wing Commander's response. He looked at Tax who nodded showing the WC that he had done right.
<br>Meanwhile, Beryl squadron was forming up for their 1st attack-run.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
"Understood, Commander Skywaler out,"
<br>As Mike brought the X-Wing around to land in the concealed hanger bay. After Mike landed the fighter he didn't get out and the technicians went right to work on the top starboard engine. While Mike was waiting for the ok from the technicians so he can be back into the fire fight around the Predator. Mike got back on the Auric Squadron frequency to see what the status of the squad was after he was hit.
<br>"Auric leader to Auric Squadron, report."
<br>"Auric 2-2 to Auric leader, flight three is lost and we are taking a pounding out here."
<br>"Thanks for the report Auric 2-2, stand by I should be back out."
<br>Mike ended the transmission and checked his status with the technicians. When Mike had his little talk with the head technician about that status of his top starboard engine. After Mike was done talking with the technician Mike contacted the Wing Commander abouit his status.
<br>"Commander Skywaler to Wing Commander, technicians are almost done and I should be back out there soon."
</p>

<p class="text">
Both sides had meanwhile suffered some losses.
<br>
<br>Two thirds of the TIE Interceptors had been destroyed, while the Avengers had much smaller losses, but a squadron of the Avengers had removed from the battlefield. One flight for repairs, the 3 other flightgroups for getting new concussion missiles. Different to the other ships it wasn't as difficult for the Avengers to remove from battlefield when damaged or out of missiles, cause the could go on full speed and transfer additional energy from weapons into the engines making them pretty much faster then the other fighters in space.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile the Republic had lost a couple of X-Wings as well, but the A-Wings were doing pretty good. Only of the A-Wings had been destroyed meanwhile. But most of the remaining X-Wings and A-Wings that hasn't returned to the Predator were low on missiles.
<br>
<br>The Dreadnaught and the the stormtrooper transports passed half of the way to the Predator. The assault transports could have been faster, but they had reduced speed to stay in formation with the aged Dreadnaught.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
"Admiral, we're slowly gaining space-superiority, but we're still having trouble with the TIE Advanced Fighters, but friendly losses are at minimum."
<br>
<br>Tax couldn't of gotten better now from his Wing Commander, he turned to the security feed running on one of the monitors, displaying the security forces barricading in the main hangar.
<br>
<br>"What's the status on the Assault Transports and Dreadnaught? and how are we holding out, are the shields holding?" Tax continued figuring the readings would take a few moments.
<br>
<br>"Sir, Avengers are rearming. Shall I order the same on our fighters?" the Wing Commander asked. Tax glanced at the monitor again, the main hangar was on high alert and there was no way the concealed hangar on-top could take on so many fighters.
<br>
<br>"Negative Commander, load Auric squadrons with concussion missiles and then form our wing up behind the Predator, our laser-batteries could provide a barrage to shoot-down hostile missiles once the Advanced TIEs return. We have to take full advantage of our batteries."
<br>
<br>"Aye aye, sir"
<br>
Still waiting on the scans of the Assault Transports and Dreadnaught, Tax firmly ordered the Turbolasers and Proton Torpedoes to intensify their attacks, giving Beryl a larger chance to drop their ordinance. Tax glanced at the monitor "Good thing I didn't leave our soldiers back on Ogompak III, if we get boarded, we wouldn't stand a chance without them."
</p>

<p class="text">
It wasn't long till Mike was back out there battling his way through TIE fighter screens above Predator. Mike's com channel beeped after he blasted a TIE Interceptor to space dust.
<br>"Wing Commander to Auric Leader, have your squad land and be reloaded with concussion missiles and form up behind Predator."
<br>"Understood, Wing Commander."
<br>After the brief order from the Wing Commander and Mike changed com frequency to Auric Squadrons frequency. So he can let his comrades know what going on and relay the Wing Commander's order.
<br>"Auric Leader to Auric Squadron, land now and get ready to be reloaded with concussion missiles. After you are done being loaded with concussion missiles form up behind Predator."
<br>"Copy that, Auric Leader." they all said at once.
<br>As Auric Squadron was landing in the concealed hangar bay to be reloaded with concussion missiles.The hanger crews went right to work and loaded the squadron with concussion missile after they landed. After a few minutes being fully loaded of a ordinance of concussion missiles and taking off again from the concealed hanger bay. Mike's squad formed up along with the other squadron station on the Predator and waiting for further orders from the Admiral or the Wing Commander.
<br>"Ok, boys stand by for further orders and keep your eyes sharp."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Thes rolled and dived, as he held tight on the TIE interceptor infront of him. 'This guy has some skill.' He thought as he surrendered to the force. Sensing his prey's wingman approaching, Thes, fired and blew the left wing off the TIE, sending it into a flat spin headed for deep space. Thes rolled on his starboard wing as the approaching interceptor cut loose at range with his lasers. Pulling his stick back and to the left he entered a weave and headed straight for the incoming interceptor, who now was having a hard time getting a lock on him. Thes cranked his stick to the right and pulled it back to his sternum, as he shot past the interceptor and found himself in the TIEs wake. "Your mine now punk." Thes cut loose with his lasers and flew through the cloud of explosive gasses. "Control my area is clear of fighters, I am out of missles, should I come in to reload?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
"Keep up the good work Thes, stay alive out there, one Auric Fighter was just lost, so you can take it's place in rearmament, you're clear to enter Hangar B and rearm." the Wing Commander glanced at Tax who nodded giving his approval, Tax knew Thes was a great pilot and arming him with some more missiles would only benefit the battle.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
"Auric Leader to Control, Auric Squadron is done with loading up on the ordinance of concussion missiles and we are standing by for further orders. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Thes landed his A-Wing in the hanger and relaxed a bit as the technitions scrambled to rearm his fighter and patch any damage.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
The X-Wings of Auric Squadron were staying in position behind Predator waiting on Mike's orders or the Wing Commanders. Mike knew they are ready to take on the Assault Transports and that old Dreadnaught. But Mike knew they will not attack the ships unless they were told to by Control. Mike got on the com channel to contact Control to see what the ETA of the Assault Transports, Dreadnaught, and the TIE Advance squadron that was removed from the battle.
<br>"Auric Squadron to Control, what the ETA of the Assault Transports, that old Dreadnaught, and the TIE Advance sqaudron that was removed from the battle. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
The dreadnaught had almost reached weapons range of the Predator while the transports were forming up to an assault on the Calamarie Cruiser. Everything what was left from the Imperial fighter defence was triing to support the transports on their way.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile in the control center of the Remnant station:
<br>
<br>"How long till we get reinforcements, Lieutenant?" The commander yelled at one of the officers in front of him opperating communication terminals.
<br>
<br>"Less then two hours, sir."
<br>
<br>"Ok, coded transmission to our groups out there, they should buy us some time, triing to disable engines of the Calamari Cruiser if possible and slowing down the progress of the Rebels."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
Thes launched from the hangar, "Control, permission to perform strafing runs on the dreadnaughts weapons systems."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
" Auric leader to Control, Permission to start strafing runs on the old Dreadnaught. "
<br>After Mike said this and waiting on the replie about the strafing runs that Auric Squadron was going to do when they get the ok. Mike had a bad felling about something was not right at all.
<br>" Auric Squadron to Control again, I have a bad feeling about this something not right at all. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Tax gave a nod to his Wing Commander. Tax straightened up and yelled:
<br>"We've got them trapped, push forward and order our wings to attack from the flanks. Attack them head's on, shields to double-front. Let's show these bastards what we're made of!"
<br>
<br>The Battery Commander nodded and leaned over his Console, pressing a number of buttons with a little sign above them representing the different Laser-Battery Sections, the buttons were called "Fire at Will" and only a few seconds after, a barrage of laser-fire was spreading out in front of the Predator, only the heavier lasers could reach the Transports and Dreadnaughts but for every second the Predator got closer and closer, resulting in heavier and heavier damage.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the Wing Commander started giving out orders as well, while all fighters were launched and ordered to attack-at-will, the Wing Commander started to prepare Hangar B technicians to load Proton Torpedoes on some of the fighters who could be recalled.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
" Auric leader to Auric Squadron fire at well,repeat fire at well. That is the Wing Commander orders which your backs. "
As Mike said this a blast rocked his X-Wing while he was flying past the Dreadnaught. That was to close next time I won't be so lucky, Mike thought as he watch the two old Clone Wars ships fire at each other.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Thes rammed his throtle to full and put his A-Wing into a weave, angling in on the dreadnaught's bridge. "Hope these are to your taste." Linking his missles on double fire, Thes unloaded all but two of his compliment of Concussion missles at the bridge watching them blossom fire on the shields, and bring them down, sowing fire through the bridge deck.
<br>
<br>"Hot Damn!!! I hit it."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
Mike punched it to full throtle and lunching two missiles into the dreadnaughts hanger bay. "See if you can recover your fighters now. " As the two concussion missiles destroyed everything and disabled the Dreadnaughts hanger bay. The blast killed anyone that was in there. When this happen Mike felt the lives he just killed through the force. Man after this battle is over I'm going to Honor those Imps that I just killed Mike thought when he was bring the X-Wing around for another pass.
<br>" Auric 2-3,Auric 2-4 form up on me. We are going to take out the engines. "
<br>" Copy that. "
<br>"Right behind you boss. "
<br>They both replied as they brought their X-Wings next to Mikes. Which He was already geting another target lock after he disabled their hanger bay.
<br>"Here we go boys put more power to your shields. The Imps will try and stop us at all cost so won't complete the run on their engines. "
<br>" Copy that Auric Leader. " they both said at the same time.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Bringing his A-wing around, Thes sees the dreadnaught start to drift downwards and to the left. "He's not going anywhere," Thes activated the com, "Control the dreadnaught appears to be adrift, any news on the remaining fighters?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
Engines room on the Dreadnaught. Commander Seragos was usually the 4th officer in the command line of the ship, but cause of recent losses in the last minutes he somehow got acting captain of the ship.
<br>
<br>"Sir, we have send a team rescuing survivors if there have been on the bridge, but we have lost the hangars as well."
<br>
<br>The commander was turning to another officer: "Shield controls back?"
<br>
<br>"Aye Sir."
<br>
<br>"Ok, all energy into the backward shields. Turn the engines on again and set collision course to the venator class:"
<br>
<br>"Sir sensors are available."
<br>
<br>"Take the last recorded course of the cruiser. We will correct it by sight. We need a communications line with someone in the front part of the ship to correct the course."
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>The Dreadnaught had several holes on it's surface and all but one Storntrooper transporter had been shot down. The last transporter had already landed on the hull of the Predator triing to break an entrance into it. Escape pods had already been started from the dreadnaught. The remaining TIE Avengers had withdrawn to the station to build a second defense line when seeing the Dreadnaught drifting.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>Somehow the Dreadnaught that were supposed to be dead started to live again. Backward shields returned with almost 40% and the Dreadnaught started to accellerate towards to the Predator. Like a ghost ship it was moving
<br>
<br>"Ok, complete evacuation." the Commander yelled into the room. On of the officers pressed a button and the alarm signal within the ship changed the noise from red alert to evacuation signal. While the commander was leaving the room he grapped a balster from a guard that was leaving the room as well and fired a few shots against against the control terminals before he left the room towards the escape pods as well.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
This isn't right Mike thought has he watch the Dread come back to life. Mike check to see if he had any missile left from the last strifing run. Which he had only two left and he was going to make them count.
<br>" Auric 2-3,Auric 2-2 do you have any missile left. "
<br>" yes two left. " replied Auric 2-2
<br>" Auric leader I only have one missile left then I'm out of concussion missiles. " replied Auric2-3
<br>" Ok boy one more pass should stop it again. "
<br>" Right behind you boss. " they both replied
<br>Mike and his flight group came around for another pass. As they they get target locks on the Dreads engines Mike notice they are puting more power to the rear shields. Mike lunched his missiles so they will knock out the sheilds. As the shields flick and die out Mike's wing man lunched his missiles along with Auric 2-3 missile. Mike watch them slam into the Dreadnuaght engines and drive housing. Which didn't slow it down at all the Dread was still moving but at a slow rate.
<br>" Auric leader to Auric Flight leader three, do you have any missile left. If so start your attack run and my flight group will give your group some cover. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Don't worry I have about seven missiles left. I'll make my attack run now. Auric 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 you're with me. Diamond formation...go!"
<br>
<br>"Auric 3-6 and 3-7 give the Y-Wing squad some cover and help out the A-Wings with the fighters. Alright 2, 3 head for the sides, 4 fly over the ship, I'll take the belly, we'll hit him at the same time."
<br>
<br>The four X-Wings take their posistion and begin to assault them. 3-2 and 3-3 take the port and starboard areas of the ship zig-zagging to avoid the turbolaser fire. As 3-4 flies over the ship, James' X-wing is flying under. Hopefully his attack is going to finish off the engines. 3-2 and 3-3 fly at the engines right when James and 3-4. "Fire!" After the order, the X-Wings launched all of their missiles into the multiple engines. Flying away from the Dreadnaught, James asks Flight Leader, "Auric Leader, I need comformation on a hit..lets see if we broke the legs on this beast."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Mike listen to flight leader 3 request about the Dread. He watch and check his scans to see if the Dread came to a stop. " Negative, the Dread is at a slow pace, Darklink. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
After hearing Hotshot's reply to his request, James has a grim look on his face. "Damn..what's going to take this thing down?!" "Ok, does anybody have any suggestions on how to take the dreadnaught down? If so Flight Group III is all ears."
<br>Making a pass over the Dreadnaught the four X-Wings get into another diamond formation, grouping back up with the rest of the group.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Auric squadron, this is leader get target locks on the Dread's turbolasers. If can't stop her we can make her defendless. " As Mike was saying this he was geting target locks on the deadnaught.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Hearing what Mike said over the comm system he then responds with a "Got it!" and proceeds with the attack. "Alright, Flight Group III form up on me, Star formation. Prepare to take out the Dreadnaught's guns! Lets do this one by the book!"
<br>
<br>The X-Wings take formation with James' fighter. 3-2 and 3-3 are right next to him and he nods to the two pilots. Breaking apart they head in towards they're targets. "Auric lead I'm starting my run now!"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Copy that Darklink, my flight group is right behind yours. " Mike's flight broke off and started their attack run. Blasting away at the Dreadnaught and watching stormies come out of the hole. Mike just left on the Dreads hull after the sheild gave way. " One for the Republic. " Mike said over the com channel.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Ha, those Imps don't know what hit em! Alright, everbody get in a straight line, me, 2, 3, and 4 will blast away the shields and guns then everbody else take, fire your remaining missiles into the hull of the dreadnaught. Lets see if we can finish this."
<br>
<br>The 12 X-Wings get in a straight line, flying over the port side of the ship. As James and his 3 wingmen take down the sheild then finnally, most of the guns on the dreadnaught's port side. The others launch missiles into the hull of the ship. Looking down from his cockpit, James sees several holes and stormtroopers flowing out of them. "Alright boys! Good job! When this is done I'll buy everyone drinks!" James says, chuckling along with his wingmates.

As the Dread sit there dead in space after being hit over and over. Mike got on the squad com channel to give more orders to his squad. " Ok, boys this is not over yet. We still have that space station to deal with." Then Mike switch channel so he could contact control. " Auric leader to control, the Dread is dead in space. Permission to start attack runs on the space station. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Wait...there's a space station?!" During the heat of the battle, James didn't even notice the station. Looking over at the orbiting fortress his face goes from excited to grim. "Hey, Hotshot, do we have any bombers left?" As he asks this he and his group are sitting at zero throttle, basically dead, in space waiting for confirmation.

<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Darklink look to your right." the Y-Wings where reforming up near the Predator and along with the other squadrons.
<br>" Auric Leader to Auric Sqaudron form up on me near the Predator."
<br>Mike brought his X-Wng around and meet his squadron near the Predator at the sametime waiting for his answer on the space station.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Alright I'm forming up right away." Him and his group form up on Auric Leader. Looking at the space station James' hand begins to shake from adrelindin just by looking at the station. This is what drove him, a secret engine inside of him. The heat of battle makes his heart race, a certain fury and passion reveals itself in battle. This is his playing field, and he loves it.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
As Mike brought his X-Wing near the Predator and watching the squadron forming up around him. Mike felt everyone of them and he knew they were ready for anything that comes at them.
<br>" Alright boys, sit tight and wait the order to attack the station. "
<br>This is it Mike thought as Darklink flight group form up and got into poisition. They all were waiting on the order to attack the station. Which Mike already asked for permission to attack the station before anything else happen.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
The station had meanwhile build a secondary defense belt out of the one and a half remaining TIE Avanger Squadrons. Three lange transports and almost 30 shuttle size ships had already left the station. Most of them already went into hyperspace. Seemed the station didn't expect their reinforcements arriving at time and so the station was starting an evacuation.
<br>
<br>The Republican task force had meanwhile lost Orange and Violet squadrons and also the original squadrons of the Predator weren't complete anymore.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
"All wings report in" Mike ordered and listen who checked in. Damnit, the squad is down two flights Mike thought as the last pilot checked in.
</p>

Looking around Thes noticed he was the only Cobalt member still alive with a working ship. "Well hell."
</p>

<p class="text">
"Give me a status people, tell me what's going on, what do we have left?" Mattias shouted out across the bridge.
<br>
<br>"Sir, our squadrons has taken quite a beating, we don't have very much left. Predator is ok though, we've repelled the boarding-attempt. The few pods that unloaded on us has been rounded up."
<br>
<br>Mattias mumbled. He saw enemy transports jumping into hyperspace one by one, the TIE Avengers were probably gonna buy time for the transports to get clear. The orders were to destroy the station, he could wait for the transports to leave. The Avengers would probably leave once the station was empty. Then he got an idea.
<br>
<br>"Wing Commander, engage the Avengers. Have our Y-Wings circle around and disable as many transports as possible, stay clear of the Avengers though. We'll capture as many of the transports as possible. Then we'll capture or destroy the station, shouldn't be much of a fuss."
<br>
<br>"Will do sir, Squadrons, listen up. Form up into groups by 4. Avengers is first priority, then the Transports and last, the station, they're emptying it so the guns are probably empty too. Go go go!"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
" Auric leader to Auric squadron, attack pattern alph and give the Y-Wings some cover. " After Mike gave out the orders. The X-Wings broke formation and excute the orders Mike just gave to them.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Copy control, I'm all alone out here, the rest of my squadron is either disabled or destroyed. Shall I continue on the Avengers or run cover for the Y-wings?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
"Got it Auric Lead! C'mon boys, lets give these Y-wings some cover." James and his group, which is now missing 3-9 and 3-12, form up on him and he forms on Mike's ship. Looking for the Y-wings to get into posistion he also keeps an eye out for TIE Avengers.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Here they come at 0 point 2-10. what your backs keep the TIE Avengers off the Y-Wings."
<br>Mike brought his X-Wing round to engage the TIEs that was coming their way. One of them took a shot at Mike which missed a few inches to his cockpit. That was way to Damn close Mike thought has he return the favor.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Thes, we got 4 pilots switching ships here, they'll be out with you in a few minutes, once they're out, form up with them and provide escort for the Y-Wings."
<br>The Wing Commander quickly checked the status on the complement fighters being prepared for launch and the pilots switching cockpits. 2 reserve X-Wings, 1 A-Wing with a laser-mark covering half the front and a Z-95 Headhunter used for light escort.. That was pretty much everything fly-worthy that the Predator had to offer, the rest of the hangar was filled to it's limit with damaged, disabled or malfunctioning fighters.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
In the command center of the station was just operated by half of the usual crew. They were organizing the evacuation.
<br>
<br>"Sir, Y-Wings on the radar, heading for the station." One of the radar officers were reporting to the commanding officer.
<br>
<br>"They may want to make a torpedon run on us. Lieutenant, contact the commander of the TIE Avengers, half of his unit should intercept the Y-Wings."
<br><br>
V3 of 6 flightgroups of TIE Avengers started to acellerate towards the Y-Wings. Their escort left formation to intercept the TIE Avengers and started to aim for the Avengers with advanced concussion missles. One second later the Avengers were aiming for the Y-Wings with their missles. A wave of missles was starting towards the Avangers and a seonced later the same situation for the Y-Wings. The TIE Avengers directly started to avoid the missles, one of the Avengers got direcly hitten by two missles and exploded, the others were fliing spirals and other complicated manuevers to get rid of their followers. Meanwhile the Y-Wings were triing to escape the missles following them as well, but their slow engines had no chances against the fast missles. A couple of their pilots edjected before their ships turned into fireballs. Meanwhile two more Avengers got destroyed by the missles following them and one more was drifting through space without control. The others got rid of the missles following them.
The Republican escort fighters had almost reached their position and were preparing to intercept them mentioning that the second were now accelerating toward to them, making their missles ready.

<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
" Watch your back Darklink you have one on your tail.' Mike said as the TIE Avengers came at them from the station. This is not my day Mike thought as he just lost another X-Wing to enemy fighter there goings another one I have to write too. The Y-wing were doing great and holding their line. At the sametime lunching their missile which they made their mark on alot of the TIE Avengers.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Cobalt squad," Thes commed as they launched in their reserve fighters, "Form up, 3, 6, and 10, take your X-wings and Headhunter and form up a flight. 9 one me. Let's keep these Y-wings as safe as can be."
<br>
<br>Thes watched as the newly formed two flight angled in on a pair of TIE's, "Let's go Nine." Thes and his wingman pulled through a loop and onto the tail of a pair of Avengers, the trailing one broke left to circle around. "Let him go nine, stay on the leader." "Copy Lead."
<br>
<br>Thes fired a pair of missles at the avenger blowing the port solar array off, and turned to starrboard as the TIE's wingman came around and lanced his fighter with laser fire. "Control I'm hit," Thes yelled, "Going EV, get a recovery shuttle out here."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
"I see him!" Bolting his X-wing forward he flips back over the TIE Avenger and gets behind it, shooting his lasers the TIE Avenger goes up in a ball of fire. "Damn, Thes is hit!" Getting back into formation he notices another one of his wingmates explode in a ball of fire, "Don't worry I'm fine!" That was 3-4's voice, "Phew..that was a close one." "Alright, lets get these Y-Wings to their objective. Control, requesting emergency pick up for Auric 3-4."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Watch it Darklink you have another one on your. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Agh, another one?!" Trying the same manuver again the TIE Avenger pilot was all the wiser. Unfortunetly the fighter James took out was that pilot's wingmate. Instantly boosting ahead the TIE outmanuvers James' X-Wing. "Crap, he's still on my tail! Can someone take this guy off of me?!" Zig-zagging to dodge the shots, James does his best to avoid a fiery death.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Hold on I'm almost there. " Mike said as he was getting a target lock.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Thanks, agh!" An emerald green flashes into his left eye. James glances over to the left side of his cockpit to find a burn mark on his upper-left wing. "Crome-dome, see if you can do anything about the sheilds!" Crome-dome was his R2 unit, he had to give it a name so he called it crome-dome.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Thes watched the battle rage around him. 'Well, the pilots in Mike's squadron seem to have some skills.' He thought.
<br>
<br>Just then a TIE exploded near him sending shrapnel into his abdomen, "GRRRRRR!!!!"
<br>
<br>Thes reached out in the Force to anyone that could hear him, and slipped into a healing trance.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
" Control were is that shuttle Thes requested. If I have to I'll give it some cover when you lunch it. " Mike felt Thes call though the force. " Hold on Thes help is on its way.." Mike sented back to Thes though the force.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"There!" Diving his X-Wing he pulls into full reverse under the TIE Avenger. "I have you now!" Blasting with quad laser setting, the four red bursts of plasma crash into the hull of the Avenger. "Crome, you get my sheilds up yet?" A translated message pops up on his viewscreen right below him reading "SHIELDS RAISED, FULL POWER TO SHEILDING? " "Nah, I can take over from here."
<br>
<br>"3-4 you doing ok?" Static is all that heard, she must of been hit by a stray bolt or plowed into one of the many fighters zooming around. "Damn..she was one of my better wingmates."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Mike set his lasers to quad beacuse he was out of missiles. After he did this he blasted a TIE that was behind a Y-Wing.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Control, this is shuttle Triage, we have Commander Nazud onboard, and are on our way back to the Predator, prepare a bacta tank. The Commander is seriously wounded in the abdominal area, and requires immediate care." The pilot switched off the com and turned to his co-pilot. "I don't know how he has managed to stay alive this long, must be his Jedi training or something."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
After Triage picked up Thes Mike felt releaved. Then Mike blasted another TIE fighter to add to is killls under is cockpit. That was following one of his wingmen.
<br>" Shuttle Triage, This is Commander Skywaler I'll keep those TIEs off your back. Until you get back to the Predator. "
<br>" Roger that Commander. " the shuttle pilot replied.
<br>Mike formed up with the shuttle and escort it back to the Predator. At the same time blasting any TIE that came in their way.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"I'll help with that escort Hotshot." After blasting away two more TIEs that were chasing a Y-wing, James takes his X-Wing into posistion beside Mike's. Escorting the shuttle back home, James notices something strange on his computer display. "This is strange..might be a glitch. Command, verify if another ship is coming into the area. My R2 unit is picking a hyperspace signal."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
After the shuttle got back in the the Predator Mike brought his X-Wing around. So he can head back to the battle near the station. Mike look down at his scan to see how many enemy fighters were left. When he was doing this his R4 unit beep at him.
<br>"Yes, lyn. "
<br>There were a lot of beeps and whistles from his R4 unit. The message was translated on the his viewscreen so he can read it and know what his droid was saying.
<br>
<br>" THERE IS A FEW TIE AVENGERS LEFT AND GETTING TARGET LOCKS ON THE STATION SIGNAL TOWER FOR YOU. "
<br>" Thanks,send them to the squad R2 units after you are done."
<br>"OK."
<br>
<br>Mike was heading towards the station when he picked up a TIE Avenger. " Damnit, here we go again. You better get off of me Imp." Mike was dodgeing all the TIE laser shots at him and he was doing a great job of it. But the last one he coundn't dodge in time."Control I'm hit." Mike yelled " Going EV, get that recovery shuttle back out here."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Barrel rolling, James' X-Wing come in on an intercept course with the TIE Avenger. Blasting it away he sees that it's too late for Mike's fighter. "Damn, sorry I'm late, you ok Hotshot?" Circling slow around Mike's floating body he tells him, "Alright, lets take out the rest of these suckers! Whoever's left of my flight group, form up on me, we're heading towards that signal tower." The two X-Wings in his flight group form behind him, looking at his aft camera's Crome provided him, James grows a frown on his face.
<br>
<br>"You two are it?" "Yep, looks like it." responds 3-2, "Just of Flight Group III though..not the whole squad. We hope.." responds 3-5. "Ok, looks like its just us three for what I see, Command we're starting our attack on the Signal Tower.
<br>
<br>The three X-Wings fly at full throttle towards the station. Barrel rolling and zig-zagging to avoid turbolaser fire they miracalusly make it to the tower without killing themselves. Locking onto the tower they burst away their lasers and the three X-Wings circle the tower and head back to the Predator to make another strike.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Mike site there in space watching the battle unfold around him. Thinking to himself Damn he got the best of me as Mike watch whats left of Auric Squadron attacking the signal tower on the station. So they wouldn't send out any more signals to Warlord Horus. " Control were is that shuttle at. I'm a siting Bantha out here."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
As much as Thes hated the feeling of floating in a bacta tank, he was glad that the rescue shuttle was able to retrieve him. 'Well,' he thought, 'I guess I can speed things up with my healing trance. I have a feeling they will need me in the next day.'
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
After the Shuttle picked him up and Mike was back on board the Predator safe and sound.Mike headed to the med bay to check on his follow pilot. That got wounded during the battle around the station and the Predator.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Ok, lets take this comm tower out!" The three X-Wings circle around the Predator's bridge and flies at the station. Blowing away any TIE avenger that get in their way, they finnally reach the station. Unfortunetly, the station gunners were ready for them, the turbolaser are much more concentrated on 3-2 and 3-5's fighters along with James'. "Try to avoid that gunfire. We need to take this comm tower out."
<br>
<br>3-2's X-wing launches his last missile into the comm tower, the tower is impacted with the warhead. It's evident that it made contact due to the fact the tower is now broken in half and is collapsing into the hull of the station. "Whoo-hoo!! Remind you to buy you a souviner when this is done!" Of course that moment will never come, for one of the turbolasers made a direct contact on 3-2's cockpit, causing the X-Wing burst into flames.
<br>
<br>"Command, we took down the comm tower, but excluding myself, I only have one man left in my flight group. Any other objectives?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Thes came out of his meditation feeling a slight pull on his breathing mask. Looking up Thes swam for the open grate. "I dont reccomend a swim in that tank if you can afford it." he told the medical attendant as he got the remaining residue washed hosed off.
<br>
<br>Thes walked into the adjoining room with a towel rapped around his waist and lay down on a bench to relax and allow his legs to regain their steadyness.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
He and 3-5's X-wing head towards the Predator awating further instructions. In an escort formation near the Predator, James looks at the fighter debris, a mixture of Republic and Imperial fighters, including floating bodies of the pilots who didn't make it. Glancing over at the station, half of it was in flames while the other half has transports and shuttles flowing out of the hanger bay. It's obvious the station was about to go, luckly for him the comm tower landed on one of the reactors, causing a chain reaction in that sector.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Mike got to the med bay to find Thes laying on the med bed. So he walked over to him and see how he was doing.
<br>"hey bub, how is the wound.? "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Sithspit!" Tax watched his Y-Wing Squadron being flanked by the TIE Avengers, the first wave of missiles were devastating to say the least. Luckily, most of them were able to bail out, and the escort fighters drew the battle away in order for the rescue shuttle to gather the pilots, something that was normally done after a battle, but there were simply no time.
<br>
<br>"Sir, I think we've won. The Avengers has been fought off, destroyed or escaped. We didn't manage to disable any of the transports but the station is non-operative." the Wing Commander reported.
<br>
<br>"Victory... but to what price Commander? Collect the dead and wounded and get us out of here..." Tax said in a deep voice, then left the bridge, clearly in a moody state of mind.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Rear Admiral Mattias Gustfsson</p>
<p class="text">
"Command, we're returning to the hanger bay." The two damaged X-Wings float near the Predator's hanger bay and let it's tractor beam pull and dock them in. Exiting his X-Wing, James takes a look at the damage. "Well, I've seen worse.." Taking his helmet off, he puts it under his arm and heads to the medical bay to pay Mike a visit.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
Thes smiled, "Well, I've had worse. The thing that saved me out there was the fact that my suit shut down around the wound. Had a bad case of hypothermia to go with it tho."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
Walking into the medical bay, the medical droid does an instant scan of James. Reading small bumps, cuts and brusies from the manuvers he did, the droid instantly tries to force him into the bacta tank. After arguing with it, he walks past it towards Thes and Mike. "Well, the two Jedi. How are you two holding up? I heard you took quite a beating sir." That was directed towards Thes.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Nothing much just checking on someone.. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Eh, I'll live."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Thes Nazud</p>
<p class="text">
" See you later, Thes. " Mike turned to face the ensign. " Follow me to my quarters. So we can talk about todays battle. " Before they left Mike wave to his freind an follow Jedi. Then Mike and James lefted for his quarters talk about today's battle.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Yes sir." Bowing to the other Jedi, James follows Mike to his quarters. "Yes, what did you want to talk about?" Looking a bit confused, but in the back of his head he's thinking, "Probably just a debreifing..I hope."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" Just debrief you about the battle. While your wingman is in the med tank. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
A breath of relief seems to exit from James' mouth by accident, but he doesn't worry about it. "So, is the station kaputt or all the sacrafices we made were all for naught.."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" It was victory for us but at cost. " Mike thinking what he has to say in letters to his dead squad members families. " About the station the captain let us know about the status of the station. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
"Alright..I'll ask the captain then." Making his way towards the door James turns around and looks at Mike. "Hey, you ok? I don't want you going crazy on everyone because of your force sensitivity. I know you could feel every single pilot who died out there."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
" You wait on that and take some rest. Thats a order. Plus I'm find I been to alot of battles and how to handle it. "
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mike Skywaler</p>
<p class="text">
Chuckling a bit at the order, James says, "Alright, good night." and heads off towards his quarters to get some rest.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant James Ory</p>
<p class="text">
After James left Mike's quarters. Mike went on to work writing his report and letters to dead squad member's families.
