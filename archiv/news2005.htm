<p class="textwhite"><b>6th November 2005: Additions</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Outer Rim War III</b>
<br><br>Colonel Aidyn Wolfwood from the Rebel Squadrons recently announced, that the RS is working on the ORW3 again. You can read the announcements here:
<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=700">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=700</a>
<br>This is a good chance again to get promoted, to get medals, or to gain the rare silver or golden pilot wings again and increase the resources of your squadron. I'm also thinking on giving out specail fleet honors again for the best squadron in the tournament.
<br>These tournaments are really important for the 5th fleet. I would be cool seeing some officers in action again who aren't usually gaming in the 5th anymore. The ORW isn't that often so it would be a great deed for the fleet doing here and there a game in ORW3.
<br>Would also be good triing to be flexible with games. Making a JO game while waiting for the next XvT match can't hurt that much.
<br>And finally, I would like to see the 5th fleet on ORW3 as one team again, not as scaterred as in the CF.
<br>Our goal isn't only to show the other fleets that we are still alive but also to wipe them off our planets. :)

<p class="textwhite"><b>3rd November 2005: Promotions and more</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
<b>Fleet Progress</b>
<br><br>Well, some discussions on several parts of the NR5F rulesystem. Feel free to take part on the discussions here:
<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=680">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=680</a>
<br><br>Till now it was nessesary for a veteran squadron to have at least one officer in the squadron that has earned silver pilot wings.
<br>Cause of the lack of ICTs in the last time veteran squadrons can also be formed when one of the officers in a squadron has the highest medal of a section. Have the list below:
<br><br>Valor of Ackbar (Highest Gaming Medal)
<br>Order of Ood Bnar (Highest OoJ Medal)
<br>Star of Valor (Highest RPG Medal)
<br>Star of Alderann (Highest Medal in general) 
<br><br><b>Career Progress</b>
<br><br>Well, especially officers in the ranks of Ensign and Second Lieutenant should check here:
<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=696">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=696</a>
<br>The Page contains a list of requirements Ensigns and Second Lieutenants need to proceed one rank.
<br>There requirements should be very easy to complete. Just contact me as soon as you reached them cause of your promotion, in case you didn't already got promoted automatically.
<br><br>A second good possibility is recruiting. Recruiters often get instantan promotions. Depending to the number of recruits you may even get fast promotions in middle and higher ranks. Just make sure Commodore Mattias Gustafsson and me person know which officers are recruited by you.
<br><br>The 3rd possibility is creating your own ship. Requirement is that you bring 3 additional members into the fleet that play the crew of the ship. We currently try to fill the actual ships so it don't makes sense creating a new ship without even a small crew. But on the other hand administrating a ship is a difficult task so it's a good way to proceed fast through junior and middle ranks.
<br><br><b>The Dark Within Campaign</b>
<br><br>The Storyline for the 'The Dark Within' Campaign is on a break point now. It's like chapter one is done and were proceeding the chapter two soon.
<br>We have some time now to think on a second attempt for an RPG. Looking for a Game Master and seeing who has time to play in the RPG and when.
<br>Please reply on the Message Board on the following topic if you want to play in the RPG:
<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=698">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=698</a>
<br><br>The Run On for the TDW Campaign can be found here:
<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=650">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=650</a>

<br><a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=651">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=651</a>
<br><br><b>Administrational</b>
<br><br>Well I guess I have the feeling of progress again. Those who are a bit longer in the 5th know that I'm going to these periods more often, usually followed by a deep depression. Nevertheless here are a couple of promotions. The higher promotions have been discussed with the Tommy and Worf, but I didn't bring them up to the council since 3 members of the council were on the promotion list.
<br><br>The following 3 officers are with the 5th fleet almost since the beginning. With the 5th fleet, they have managed to to move from the Empire to the New Republic without loosing their Dark and Evil side completely.
<br>Vice Admiral DG Karper and Vice Admiral Benjamin Simon complete their career with the 5th Fleets top ranking of Admiral. Admiral VDJ Karper gets the honorary title of Fleet Admiral.
<br>All three officers had their ranks for several years now. The list of things they have done in these years is pretty long so i don't want to add the lists here.
<br>Congrats Benni, DG, VDJ.
<br><br>Captain Mattias Gustafsson also known as Tax Collector has done a lot for the New Republican 5th Fleet, especially with managing the Naval Academy Coruscant and the Republican Diplomatic Corps. He also participated a lot in the TDW Campaign and was very active in several discussions on the Fleet Message Board. He managed to get part of the High Command as Junior Councillor.

<p class="textwhite"><b>11th October 2005: Fleet Update</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
It's been one month ago since the last fleet command report. In the last month the number of recruits increased drastically and so the number of graduates from the academy. Now we are in need of vital squadron commanders who can motivate their squadron members to be active and keep them informed on everything that happens in the 5th. 
<br><br><b>Fleet Structural Progress</b>
<br><br>Currently we have the problems, that we have more recruits and graduates then experianced officers that are willing to guide the new members. So there are a couple of discussions how to solve that. 
<br>Especially the Communication has to be increased together with the unit feeling and star wars athmosphere. 
<br>Discussions are here: 
<br>More on that here: <a href="http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=680" target="mboard">http://www.mindblock.net/nrforum/viewtopic.php?t=680</a>

<br><br><b>Honoring Commodore Marcus Gustavsson</b>
<br><br>Cyr made a great number of games on the last ICTE gaming night. He made 13 games (6 wins, 7 losses). Making him the most active ICTE player in the 5th fleet. 
<br>Through his effort the 5th fleet often got honorably mentioned within the other clubs too. So he gets a medals that havn't been given out for some time. Commodore Marcus Gustavsson hereby gets the Hero of the Ground Forces medal. 
<br>Additionally for taking part in the gaming part of the TDW campaign he gets 19 advance points for himself or the Battlegroup Hunter. (Speak to your group commander how to spend them)  
<br><br><b>The Dark Within Campaign</b> 
<br><br>The RPG part of the TDW is running pretty well at the moment. The Run On currently passed the 100th post. At some point we can think again on implementing a RPG into the storyline. 
<br>The gaming in the campaign is still a bit low, but I guess that can be increased. 
<br>The Run On for the Campaign can be found at:

<p class="textwhite">
<a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/academy/courses.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/academy/courses.htm</a>
<br>
<br>There are new courses at the academy, the Advanced Naval Academy exam has been splitten into 3 different courses: An officers grade, a commander's grade and a captain's grade. Officers can get an Advanced Training Medal for each of the courses. So everyone may get 3 ATMs in total, exept of those who managed the old Advanced Academy Exam. They can get 3 ATM aditionally to the one they already got.
<br>
<br>You can directly start doing the couses, but please wait till Tax is back for sending in the results. You can also help each other with the exams, just please don't post answers to the questions on the message board or in the main channel or so.
<br>
<br>I think the captain's grade is pretty difficult, or at least should be, sore for an officer that is one year or more in the fleet it should be no problem, but for a junior officer, well we will see.

There is a new section on the roster called: "Special Honors and Personal Items", it's below the Medal Case.
<br>The section has been added to add things like Lightsabers and Service Ribbons:
<br><a href="../main/nhqrib.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/main/nhqrib.htm</a>
<br>You can see an example for lightsabers at HA Commskywalkers profile:

<br>Currently every Jedi Knight or higher is equipped with one of the standart lightsabers.

<p class="textwhite"><b>9th August 2005: Fleet Compendium Online</b></p>

<p class="textwhite"><b>Fleet Compendium</b>
<br>
<br>The Fleet Compendium is online:
<br><a href="../manuals/compend.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/manuals/compend.htm</a>
<br>There are no new rules in, maybe exept of the lightsaber thing in the subgroup section, but it gives a good overview on everything that was part of a couple of different sources till now.
<br>I would like especially command officers read their sections (Squadron Commanders: Commanding a squadron, Subgroup Directors : Subgroups and so on)
<br>
<br><b>Inter Club Campaign with the Star Vipers</b>
<br>
<br>Well I got an offer from Sector Admiral Phoenix Berkana, commander of the Starvipers to do a common RPG/Gaming Campaign with them.
<br>I guess it's a pretty interesting thing, if we would get enough RPG gamers and gamers for that together.
<br>
<br><b>ORW3</b>
<br>
<br>Well I can't say I'm up to date on the current stand of the ORW3 discussions. Last point we were discussion technical elements. There were problems in programming the page and the bot, or better in finding someone with the knowledge to do that. But I don't think the ORW3 project will be given up, ORW just usually has a problematic start.
<br>
<br><b>Activities</b>
<br>
<br>Well a couple of officers asking what to do till then.
<br>
<br>- First of all Squadron/Wing/Ship Commanders should encourage their officers to do an own office page or making their uniform or writing a background story for their character, and if an office is missing for putting that on it could be brought on the message board.
<br>
<br>- It's currently a problem getting someone for a ladder game, but asking in the fleet channel for an opponent don't hurts too. If you don't care playing an officer for another club there is also the Inter Club Training even on saturdays.
<br>
<br>- Homepages, well there are a couple of homepages missing, subgroup pages, ship pages, there are nearly no squadron pages done. Would be cool if responsible officers collect some of the new members and put such a page together. Training HTML skills is never bad.
<br>
<br>- Joining Subgroups, ... Well I guess Captain Mattias Gustafsson has a lot to do with all the cadets, I'm sure he could use help, I guess it's the same with the Diplomatic Corps where a couple of clubs need to be contacted regulary. And the NRN needs a lot of writers too.

<br><b>Upgrade of the VSD Predator</b>
<br>
<br>The Victory Stardestroyer Predator of Battlegroup Hunter will be replaced with a Venator Class Stardestroyer. I guess everyone seen the ship in Episode 3. The new ship has a fighter load of 4 squadrons. Captain Mattias Gustafsson will become the new Wing Commander of that ship.
<br>Ongoing with that the Imperial tech tree will be changed a bit filling the Venator Class Stardestroyer into the empty position of the 4-squadron-carrier.
<br>
<br><b>Other news</b>
<br>
<br>I have added the Progress Coin of Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind meanwhile. It wasn't pretty sure if he got it or not out of the forum discussion.
<br>a) Medals that result on a period of service should be given out by one of the line commanders of the officer expecting the award, while medals given out for an event/tournament/game should been given out by the organisator of the event.
<br>b) Please check if you are allowed to give out that medals first, awarding specific medals requires specific positions in the fleet.
<br>c) Please do it a bit more formal, not as 6th or 7th post in a discussion thread. Sometimes its worth enough starting a new topic for giving out a medal.
<br>
<br>Commander Talon Jade in back in the 5th fleet, he is the new commander of Eagle squadron on the CRS Warspite.

Please check if there are missing results on ladder term 1 (<a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/gaming/ladder.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/gaming/ladder.htm</a>). If you report ladder games in the next week, please note if the belong to ladder term 1 (when you made the games in June or before) or ladder term 2 (in case the games have been made in July). After this weeks all reports automatically count for ladder term 2.
<br>
<br><b>Joining Forms</b>
<br>
<br>Well, Captain Mattias Gustavsson (Tax Collector) Finally appears of the joining forms instead of Admiral VDJ Karper. Sorry that took so long, I thought I had made that long before ...
<br>The Academy subpage is still a bit outdated. I'm thinking on generally redoing the page when I find some time.
<br>
<br><b>CRS Warspite</b>
<br>
<br>Few months ago the CRS Warspite left the Imperial Warlords and joined the New Republic. Meanwhile the ship has become a vital part of the New Republician Navy, ... even without a homepage to present. It's sad that the officer that initiated all this, the retired Lieutenant Commander Talon Jade can't profit of this development, I'm sure he would have a ranking and medal bar that would suit him better meanwhile. Nevertheless, i would like to give the Commander a Republican Service Medal remembering the great deads he did for the Republican navy.
<br>Also special thanks to the Lieutenant Commanders Destavol Gin and Gene Starwind that followed Lieutenant Commander Talon Jade as captain of the CRS Warspite.

<br><b>RPG Medal</b>
<br>
<br>In an discussion with Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind I mentioned we don't have a RPG medal that don't requires OoJ membership. In past much of the RPG concentrated on the OoJ but since there are a couple of RPGs or RPG like things navy based too, a medal for RPG participation wouldn't be wrong. So I have added the <b>Progress Coin</b> to the medals. The medal isn't thought to be given for participation on a single RPG, more for continous participation over a period.
