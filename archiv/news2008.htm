<p class="textwhite"><b>29th November 2008: Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
The 3rd Fleet Command Report this month, this is almost a new record. Sure the end of the year is comming and some stuff has to be done.
<br>
<br>Well first of all, a new campaign has started. This is kind of a prelude while the main part of the campaign is starting next year, but still a good chance grabbing some medals, show some activity for promotions, ...
<br>
<br>The activity in the first week is a bit decent maybe cause I thought on starting it a bit slower then the other ones, maybe cause of other difficulties I don't know. Well, this campaigns build the In Caracter history of the fleet, so it would be cool if many members of the 5th take part. You don't need to play leading roles in this Run On if you don't like to. Maybe just one or two posts can show you role in the history of the 5th fleet. You also show you are active and you qualify for the campaign medal and a competition medal given out a the end of the campaign. Especially now where the story has started it should be very easy to get into it. Sure, you can start at any time of the Run On, it's just the last you join, the more you have to read to get into the storyline.

<br>Well Commander Keiran Halcyon is in his rank for more then 4 months now, and he shows pretty continously a good activity. I were thinking his promotion would take one or two more weeks, but several councillors were very enthusiastic on his promotion.
<br>
<br>So congrats Keiran and keep up with the good work.

<p class="textwhite"><b>17th November 2008: Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
A short report this time. Besides the Fleet Mission Run On, that will surely start in the near future the campaign will slowly start in the next weeks.
A bit slowly with a normal Run On, but with additional Gaming Competitions after the holidays.
Those who like to get in training for these events, the Inter Club Training is still Saturdays on undernet.
The campaign is planned to be a bit longer then the last one. The last campaigns were planned as mortal strikes against our opponents and ended in borderline skirmishes, this time we need to break through the enemy lines and force a decision.
So get a bit discipline your ships and you squadrons prepared for battle, cause this is where we are going to.
<br>
<br>Some positive news from Auric Squadron. Lieutenant Aleksandr in the new Squadron Commander after Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler jumped the ladder up and here are the first promotions comming.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Lieutenant Aleksandr</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
<br>Lieutenant Aleksandr has been some month in rank now, showed some activity over the time and recently got Squadron Commander. Some may have the impression he got promoted cause of the personnel advance, but in the 5th fleet officers get promoted for the service they did to the fleet.
<br>I'm sure Lieutenant Commander Aleksandr's abilities as squadron commander will profit him for the next promotion. 
<br>Congrats Aleksandr.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Ensign Jefardi</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br>Well, Ensign Jefardi had an overall good start in the fleet and fully reached the reguirements for this rank. 
<br>Congrats Lieutenant.

<p class="textwhite"><b>3rd November 2008: Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
First of all, hello everyone.
<br>Well, some time passed since the last Fleet Command Report, and somehow my reports tend to be pretty anti-cyclic compared to the overall activity in the fleet. But before I'm writing longer stories about this topic, let's proceed to the first relevant topic.
<br>
<br>Reviewing the situation I have digged out an older project we had a few times in the past. Quickly described as: 'You get a ship if you can fill it.'
<br>It's a good chance of someone in the junior ranks to get into a position that is usually reserved for senior officers, on the other hand the officers need to bring enough new members into the fleet to have an active ship then. It may look a bit unusual a Lieutenant commanding a Calamari Cruiser, but well.
<br>Some of the verterans may still know that commisioning/decommisioning ships is usually the responsibility of the Group Commanders, but I should be able to arrange this. Maybe not each ship type or in each Battlegroup, but at least a command of a ship of the carrier class should be possible.
<br>So if you are interested, please write me a message on the message board, can also be a private message, or if you catch an active command officer in the IRC room, you can ask him to redirect the message as well.
<br>For officers with smaller ambitience we can surely talk about getting a wing or squadron as well, with surely less required new members.
<br>If you have questions feel free to post a comment to the topic or contact me via private message.
<br>
<br>Well, while High Admiral Commskywalker is prepairing the new Fleet Mission Run On there is still place for a second Fleet Mission Run On. So if you have an idea on a story and/or want to make the Game Master for such a Fleet Mission Run On feel free to contact me. By the Way, it should be something in our own timeline again.
<br>If you are interested in Run Ons, I would like to invite you to the current non-commissioned Run On:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1959">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1959</a>
<br>
<br>High Admiral Matt Sifi has also made a poll about what you would like to see on activities in the near future:

<br>
<br><font color="#ffff22">High Admiral Matt Sifi</font> gets a Republican Service Medal for all the updates he did in the last month on several 5th fleet media.
<br>Well since years Matt keeps the 5th fleet running at several points, some more visible, some less. And it's pretty normal in the 5th fleet to give out a medal for creating 5th fleet related stuff. Sure Matt does much more in the fleet, but that's usually handled a bit different medal-wise.
<br>So thanks Matt for all you efford you are putting into the fleet.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Ensign Jarod Isod</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br>Well, there isn't too much to say on the new Lieutenant, cause he isn't too long in the fleet now, but he had an excellent start and completed the requirements for the promotion pretty well.
<br>Congrats Lieutenant.

<p class="textwhite">
<font color="#ffff22">Commodore Mike Skywaler</font> is hereby promoted to Rear Admiral.
<br>I know, this was planned differently in the High Command Council, but cause Mike is taking a pause and retireing from his position as Squadron Commander I'm giving out the promotion a bit earlier.
<br>Commodore Mike Skywaler is more then a year in his rank now, and shown as a top active officer in that time. He managed Auric Squadron pretty well in that time and showed a lot of ambitience in several subgroups.
<br>Exellent job Mike.
<br>Good luck with your Real Life ambitience, and in case you will have some more free time in future again you can talk to me about a position as Wing Commander.

<p class="textwhite">
Well, as mentioned in the headline, <font color="#ffff22">Rear Admiral Wolverine</font>, Group Commander of Battlegroup One is hereby promoted to Vice Admiral.
<br><br>First of all, sorry for the 3 weeks delay, again ... Usually I would say you get 3 weeks bonus on your next promotion, and surely you will get them, but I guess 3 weeks don't matter too much in the rpomotion to admiral.
<br><br>Well, I guess you all know Wolverine from his activity in several subgroups of the fleet, in several run ons from his service on the payback or as Group Commander. Wolverine is meanwhile a long time member, well he was a long time member before too, so the list of deeds he did for the fleet in inter club games, relations, roleplaying or managing is large enough to exeed Matt's traffic limit.
<br><br>So congrats on your promotion, Wolverine and best luck on your way to Admiral.

<p class="textwhite"><b>1st August 2008: Run Ons and Medals</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
I guess most of you are just interested interested in who got the medals, but there are some words from me and the High Command Council first about giving medals especially for Run Ons.
<br><br>We had in past the rules that only Fleet Mission Run Ons get rewarded by medals. This is just another exeption from this rule, but it will be the last exeption (In case the council don't overrule me in that point). So from now on medals are just given for participating in FMROs again. In past just the FMROs and Campaigns were stickied, but somehow admins changed that and stickied not commissioned Run Ons as well. So Fleet Mission Run On threads have to be titled 'FMRO Title' now so the roleplayers can identify them.
<br><br><br>What is a Fleet Misison Run On?
<br>Well, a Fleet Misison Run On is a commisioned Run On, so there need to be a council discussion on that topic. Ideas for fleet mission run ons can be sent to every member in the fleet council who can bring it up to the council, and basically each ship has at least one member in the fleet council. There are a few extra rules for fleet mission run ons that can be found in the fleet manual and on the board. Here are the most important:
<br><br>- Every Member should have the possibility to join the Run On.
<br>So everyone has the same chance on getting the medal. Basically this disqualifies the squadron Run Ons. It's not nessesary that all ships of the fleet have to be in the Run On. Members of other ships can usually be written in, as reinforcements from another ship, as visitors, playing a Jedi/Ambassador role ...
<br><br>- FMROs are in the timeline never parallel.
<br>There can be two FMROs at the some time running on the Roleplaying board, but in the Star Wars timeline one plays after or before the other one. Same reason, everyone has to have the chance on playing in the Run On.
<br><br>- FMROs have to play over 2 to 3 months.
<br>Basically this rule is to keep the Run Ons compareable cause of the medals. It's not serious when the Run On takes longer, but there aren't automatically higher medals for it. If the story is too large for 2 to 3 month, it can be splitted into several Fleet Mission Run Ons. This way it's also easier for new players to come into the run on. (With the start of part 2, part 3 ...)
<br><br><br>About the Medals in the 5th fleet.
<br>There are two traditions in the 5th fleet in this topic. One is Quality over Qantity. So in many cases a higher medal is given out instead of a number of smaller medals. The other is that there is a kind of stability. Means Medals keep the same worth over the time. It's to prevent the inflation of medals I experianced a bit in other clubs. Sure medals should be taken that important, cause the main reason for taking parts in activities should be fun. That's absolutly true. But with the same reason it don't hurts much showing consequence in these decisions.
<br><br><br>So, to the point, most members waited for. Well there has has been a large discussion about the medals given for the roleplaying and a couple of different oppinions on that. I have reviewed around 10 Run Ons that took part over the last 3 months. There were a large spectrum of different members taking part in a few of these Run Ons, some with more High Command officers, others with members of specific squadrons. I have taken a large set and a normal set (so some of the participiants have 2 medals)

<p class="textwhite">
Well, the next part of the promotions. These took a bit longer cause they went through the council (Currently nessesary for everything higher than Lieutenant.) Blame me for the administrative announcements I added to the second part of the post, but most of them don't have the importance to earn an own thread in the announcement board.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Lieutenant Commander Keiran Halcyon</font> is hereby promoted to Commander.<br>Congrats Keiran.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Commander Liedan Aish</font> is hereby promoted to Captain.<br>Congrats OBurn.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Captain Whitewolf</font> is hereby promoted to Commodore.<br>Congrats Whitewolf.
<br><br>All 3 officers have shown pretty constant and average activity while they were in their (past) rank and a couple of dedication in the Run Ons played here. Overall a pretty solid efford that earned them these promotion.<br>So once against congrats everyone.
<br><br>As I have warned you already a bit above to the administrational part.
<br><br>a) Well till now I hoped I would be pretty much bug free in my releases, but when adding the last medals of the first term 2008 to the rosters I seen that there were a problem with medals for new members, that weren't in the fleet in 2007 already. Nevertheless, bug repaired and Medals should be out now.
<br><br>b) Made a couple of smaller changes all over the page last week. Gaming Ladder and Medal Database should be up to date:
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/main/battles.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/main/battles.htm</a>
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/gaming/ladder.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/gaming/ladder.htm</a>
<br>Ladder medals for the term have already been given out. Special thanks to every participiant of the 1st term 2008 ladder. The Fleet history has alse been revied again, with a couple of smaller changes as well as adding the medal database to it. The Imperial archives had already been integrated into the history, so I guess I will drop the seperate Imperial archives and Medal Database pages over the year since they are already part of the history now.
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/index.html">http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/index.html</a>
<br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/archiv.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/archiv/archiv.htm</a>
<br>Well there are some other changes in the fleet pages I guess most members won't evem mention. Nothing too important, just smaller parformanece or style adjustments.
<br><br>c) The High Command and the Command Staff pages should be up to date now. Members in the council should have their advisor seal now, ... I hope. Still hard coded in the profile so I'm usually not too ambitioned to change them. :roll: Nevertheless, they should be up to date now.
<br>Revieving the command staff pages showed me that this TBA person is pretty much overburden at the moment with so many jobs at the same time. I guess he or she would be happy if you contact the specific Commanders to see if you can fill the specific spots to help out TBA so he don't has too many jobs to do at the same time.
<br><br>Well i guess that's all for the moment. Expect some some small additional amount or administrational ... ehrm boring ... things in the next time from me and/or other council members. Before we can get some usefull additions done :D .

<p class="textwhite"><b>16th March 2008: Fleet Command Report</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Hello everyone, a few of you have already asked for a new fleet command report. This one should have given out one or two weeks earlier, but ok...
<br>
<br><b>10th Anniversary</b>
<br>
<br>First of all we had 10th aniversary on the 1st march 2008. I guess 10 years this are 2 or 3 internet generations. (... Somehow sounds like the statement of last anniversary, I better change the topic here :) )
<br>Nevertheless the 'Happy Birthday' thread can still be found on the message board and those who haven't qualified for the anniversary medal can still do this through making a nice post there.
<br>The anniversary medals are maybe the easiest to get medals. That's thought that way, it's a bit like the membership awads in other fleets you get for each year you are active member or so, but out of tradition we have it this way.
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1734" target="mboard">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1734</a>
<br>
<br><b>Mobilisation Phase</b>
<br>
<br>Well the mobilisation phase has more or less started inoficially. Ships have now time to sort their stuff before the qualification starts. You can apply with your ship for the qualifications through making a post in the Council forum. (I think more or less each relevant ship has one or two of it's members in the council.) Or if not possible contact one of the other councillors that port it for you on the board.
<br>The applications can be done while the entire mobilisation phase that is arond a month, so you have time to discuss things in the command staffs of the ships.
<br>Each ship needs a specified number of players for the qualification cause the ships are more or less competitions in the campaign so the qualification makes sure the ships are able to compete against each other.
<br>This is a bit the time to get new recruits, activate reserves and train with the active personnel to be prepared for the comming qualificatiions. Currently it's planned a ship need 4 run on players and 3 gamers, still need to be sorted out which games this should be, but I'm pretty sure XvT, XWA and Rebellion would count for the qualification, not because they aren't allowed during the camapign. Just those who are pretty much used from several ships at the same time to ensure there is a real gaming potential there to compete against each other.
<br>Are 7 active officers required for the qualification now? No, technically the minimum is 4. A member can count for the role playing and for the gaming qualification as well.
<br>
<br><b>Changings in the Venator Class Stardestroyer Predator</b>
<br>
<br>Commodore Thes Nazud has been made the newest Carrier Captain of the ship of the Venator Class Stardestroyer Predator.
<br>Well, again congrats Thes from my side to the newest Carrier Captain. He will surely continue the sucessful progres of the Predator in the last years.

<br>
<br><b>New Group Commander</b>
<br>
<br>Battlegroup One has after 8 year a new Group Commander, Rear Admiral Wolverine, a long time veteran who is surely pretty much known in here.
<br>Armed and bloddy negotiations on management of the Battlegroup have already started and can be found here:

<br>
<br><b>New 5th Exploit</b>
<br>
<br>Well, Rear Admiral Wolverine realeased a new issue of the New Republican News magazine, well not really new, but at least newer then the last Fleet Command report.
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1727" target="mboard">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1727</a>
<br>
<br><br><b>Promotions</b>
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Fleet Admiral VDJ Karper</font> is hereby promoted to High Admiral.
<br>Well in the 5th fleet it's usual that an officer gets a couple of small medals for his work during the time he is in the position, but a big medal at the end of this part of his job, when he cares for other aspects of the fleet. VDJ has been several years Carrier Captain, first of the Interdictor Vampire, which got replaced by the Victory Stardestroyer Predator, which got replaced by the Venator Stardestroyer Predator.
<br>VDJ is also one of the longest active members in the fleet and several years in his rank now, being in a couple of command positions besides the Carrier Captain and in the council since then.
<br>Usually when VDJ gave his Carrier Captain position to Thes after so many years this would have required a big medal, maybe bigger then a Star of Alderaan. So the council decided on promoting VDJ to the highest rank in the 5th fleet, to High Admiral.
<br>Congrats VDJ.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Ensign Alanna Vos</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br>Congrats Lieutenant.
<br><br><br>Well there is a list of medals from Wolverine and Ash, will give them out with the next part of the fleet command report with the other topics I postphoned till then.

<br><br><b>Campaign 2008</b>
<br><br>Well, there were a few questions about when is the new campaign and what is it about, Well, to the time, I'm not sure myself, originally I had planned it for autumn, but currently I'm playing with the idea starting the campaign in spring. The form of the new campaign makes a lot of preparation nessesary before it can start.
High Admiral Matt Sifi had the idea, middle of 2007 that the ships of the 5th fleet could compete against each other in the comming campaign, so each ship that takes part needs to have role players and gamers. To ensure the ships have enough personnel for the campaign we have a qualification before where the ships have to show that they have enough active members to compete in the tournament. Before the qualifications the command staffs of the ships have some time to mobilize their ships.
<br><br><b>The mobilization</b>
<br>Well here carrier captains and their staffs have time to train their members, get their reserves active and maybe recruit additional personnal for their ships. Usually we don't have often ship to ship transfers, but in this time we have an absolute no on transfers, to prevent commanders recruiting the personnel from the other ships, competing in the campaign or not. If you recruit additional members from outside of the 5th, make sure to inform High Admiral Matt Sifi from them so he will asign them to your ships.
<br><br><b>The qualifications</b>
<br>The qualifications will start with a FMRO splitted into several parallel threads, one for each ship that tries the qualification. Those officers of ships not in the qualifications can chose one of the threads to play in with. Everyone can also play opponent characters in the threads of the other ships.
While this time there will be gaming nights as well for the gamers to qualify, I think twice a week. Members can also qualify through the ICTE. A ship needs 4 regular run on players and 3 regular gamers to qualify; members can qualify for gaming and run ons as well. For the gamers there might be discussions at the end of the qualifications about those members with exotic platforms and how many posts, matches can be counted as regular.
Only ship members count for the qualifications, not members lend from other ships. I'm not sure what happens if not enough ships qualify, will discuss this in the council in case it happens.
<br><br><b>The campaign</b>
<br>During the campaign members of ships that didn't take part on the qualifications or didn't pass the qualifications can chose which ship they are fighting for. They can chose their side whenever they want to till the end of the campaign, but once they chosen a ship, they have to stay with this side till the end of the campaign.
<br>The campaign will start as a normal Run On while the campaign the ships will reach waypoints, like a ship goes into battle with another carrier, for reaching the next waypoint the members of the ship and their helpers need to complete a special task, like making a specified number of points in multiplayer games.
Before the task isn't completed the ship can't win the battle and the Run On can't proceed to the next waypoint. That's why it's nessesary that each ship have a number of Run On players and gamers onboard. Usually the tasks for each ship are parallel, at least at the beginning, later when one ship completed its task before another one, the next task can also start earlier then those of the other one.
I'm also planing on tasks that are going to all competing ships, but only the ship that completes the task first or completes the task best can proceed to the waypoint, while the other ships have to got to alternative waypoints. Well, is all a bit complex, will go more into detail when the campaign starts.
<br>The storyline is currently in work, maybe to uncover sith plans or catch an artefact before the sith can do or rescue a Republicn VIP from the Remnant. But we are playing some time after the downgoing of the empire, so space battle with large Remnant fleets will become more rare then before.

<p class="textwhite"><b>1st January 2008: Happy New Year</b></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Happy new year everyone, or at least happy new year to those in the old world and happy new year in a few hours to those living in the new world.
<br>The 10th online anniversary of the 5th fleet is comming this year. maybe 10 years aren't that long in the life, but 10 years are aeons in internet.
<br>Many things changed since then 33 and 56k modems are slightly history, also internet pages that looked like ASCII art as well as e-mail adresses without spam.
<br>Much has changed in a club that started with mailing around few kB sized custom modules for DOS games, to well, whatever club we are now.
<br>I'm kinda curious on the developments this year will bring.
<br><br><br>Well, what is comming in 2008. Basically we will play the last month of the 10th year after the battle of Endor. Our main opponent will still be Sith and the Imperial remnant, even if there isn't too much of the empire left to fight with.
<br>But I guess the degeneration of the empire will be a topic in the comming RPGs.
<br><br>The campaign this year will be a bit different then the campaigns before. There had been a couple of discussions ealier 2007 about integrating more other activities in campaigns then just Run Ons. Sure that was the plan of the other campaigns too, but it willl be a bit more restrictive this time.
<br>Basically it's a challenge between the different ships of the 5th fleet. Progress requires completing different roleplaying and gaming tasks, therefore there will be qualifications which ship will take part on the campaign. More details on the campaign later.
<br><br>Would also be cool if we have some more FMROs in the next time, especially in the last half we didn't have too many of them.
<br>For those who don't know what a FMRO is, it's a Run On with some limitations, one is that it should not take longer then 3 months, another one is that every member that wants to take part can take part with his character.
<br>If you are intersted in game mastering such a FMRO please contact one of the Fleet Concillors with your plot idea so it can be discussed in the council.
