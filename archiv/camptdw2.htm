Helm you've got the bridge, I'll be in my office medidtating, give me a holler when we exit hyperspace.
<br>
<br>Right sir!
<br>
<br><i>Gene would slink on off the bridge, he was extremely tired, but, the awkward feeling he had in the force....just kept him awake, walking into his office, he would silently sit down on a small mat and began to medidtate, slowly floating in the air upside downas he searched the force, attempting to understsand what was going on</i>

<p class="text">
<i>Raul had come back to the Warspite as he had been relieved, his R-unit rather happy that he had returned safely. He slipped his flight suit off as he reported to the flight officier, and began tomake his way towards his quarters. He expected that Gene would get a promotion out of this, and a few other things as well...perhaps a new ship, or a command on another place...or command of the group as a whole. He wasn;t sure...nor did he really care. He just wanted the chance to keep flying...he didn't want to be turned into some aged tactician who plotted the battle from the bridge of a big ship. He always thougth best on his feet, anyways. So, he was prepairing for changes as the Warspite entered hyperspace...heading towards the rendevous point. Changes to his squad...changes to his life. he had lost a lot of good pilots during the conflict...names he would have etched in hismemory for the remainder of his days. He shed a single tear as he thought of them fondly, something making him very...forlorn. But, he fought it down, trying to remember what he had been taught...there was a time to mourn, and a time to plan. This was a victory...even at such a terrible cost.</i>

<p class="text">
<i>Tax arrived at the bridge, everything was looking good, a staff change had occured and the Predator was right about to drop out of hyperspace.</i>
<br>
<br>"Take us out of hyperspace, helmsman."
<br>
<br><i>The Predator came out of hyperspeed. Tax was standing at the windows, looking out over the massive gathering. He could see freighters, containers, fighters and a whole lot of capital ships. He could see the Hamburg and the Zentar along with their escort ships.</i>
<br>
<br>"Hail them, This is Captain Mattias Gustafsson, requesting docking clearance. The Warspite should be a few minutes behind us."
<br>
<br>"Welcome Predator, you have docking clearance in Dock 2. Welcome back!"
<br>
<br>"Thank you. Well helm, you heard him, take us to Dock 2."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>would remain in meditation till Warspite exited hyperspace, a bleep coming form his comlink "Sir, We've exited hyperspace" but..Gene had already made to grab a new robe and cloak and walked on out, heading on up to the bridge, he'd salute his crew and take his place in his command chair</i>
<br>
<br>Request docking procedures with the nearest freighter and get us all supplied up, afterwards,, send a message to the Zentar asking if Master Corran is onboard, as I need to seek personal consel with him, and prepare my shuttle if he is aboard and also, send a message to Tax and see if he'd like to be invited with the majority of his ship  to some kind of huge feast aboard the Warspite or some other huge capitol ship with a large enough hangar bay...think we all deserve some damn good food and some RnR.
<br>
<br><i>chuckling lightly as he did had to bring in alittle humour to his crew, smiling as he watched his crew...well...work their magic, soon docking with the nearest freighter</i>

<p class="text">
<i>Raul emerged from his quarters, having decided that he would have enjoyed a little of the rest and relaxation that would be afforded the crew, especially while the Warspite was being repaired at the base. So, he made his way towards the bridge, hoping to have a word or twi with Gene about things. He still thought something was not quite right in the man who had taken it upon himself to be his mentor...and he had always trusted his gut feelings in matters like this...old smuggler habit. So, as he made his way down the lift, towards the bridge, he was going over in his mind just how he was going to ask this...it wasn't something you just blurted out.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
<i>The Predator had finished it's docking procedures when the Warspite arrived. Tax nodded alittle, he looked at his comm officer.</i>
<br>
<br>"Hand me the microphone, I'd like to make a ship annoucement"
<br>
<br>"Here you go Captain."
<br>
<br>"Attention Predator personnel. Captain Mattias Gustafsson speaking, I would like to thank you all for a mission well done. We all fought hard, together we found the way to victory. Victory was found at a hard cost, we have lost many good men, men and women who fought for the Republic, who fought for freedom and who fought for the well being of this galaxy. I would like one minute of silence in dedication of those who did not make it back here with us today. Starting now."
<br>
<br><i>One minute passed under complete silence</i>
<br>
<br>"Thank you, now go with heads high because you can all say that you were there that day, when the Venator-class Star Destroyer Predator took it's first victory agains the Imperial Remnants. Now go back to work because theirs plenty more of them out there!"
<br>
<br><i>Tax let his words dwell in the heads of his staff before he gave the microphone back to the comm officer</i>
<br>
<br>"Commander Starwind contacted us, he's inviting us to a celebration someplace later on."
<br>
<br>"Ah yes, I believe Grand Admiral Simon and the HC was planning alittle something. Tell him that he will be contacted by HC about celebrations."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Lucius left for his quarters and sighed with relief, as he sat on the small bunk bed and lit a cigarette.  Lucius closed his eyes and remembered hos he lost many of his comrades in the battle, as he even saw some of them die right before his eyes.
<br>
<br>The ensign smirked as he got up from his bed and walked around the room taking last puffs from a cigarette.  "these things will kill you" laughed the cadet that walked through the doors of the room.  Lucius smirked and shook cadet's hand.</i>
<br>
<br>"come, celebrations are almost begun" <i>smiled the cadet and both left for the main hall.</i>

<br>

<br>Eh..well...as long as the HC gives us some good food and such, I won't be disappointed.

<i>The lift opened ont he bridge level, and Raul stepped forth from it, and looked around for a few moments. He hadn't been back up here since he had taken command of the Warspite for a short trip a few months back. He shook his head slightly as he began to make his way towards the comm, and as he did so, he spoke softly...</i>
<br>
<br>"Commander Starwind, may I have a moment please?"
<br>
<br><i>Formal as always, here on the bridge, as it was not good to try to make either of them look less than they were...especially in light of what had happened. Gene would be a bonafide hero, after keeping the group alive with his lightsaber tactics, and his leadership ability...as well as saving the Warspite from an almost certain doom. What had he done, anyways, save for dogfight? He pushed those thoughts down, as he waited for a response...</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
<i>would salute back to Raul...aye, formal as usual, looking around as his helm staff as he lightly said</i>
<br>
<br>Aye, mandatory break for you all, come back in 5 minutes.
<br>
<br><i>the crew got on up and left, some were happy to go get a donut break, turning back to Raul he would nod slightly</i>
<br>
<br>Aye, I am as shocked as you finding a sith lurking about that station so soon.
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax met Lucius in the main hall</i>
<br>
<br>"Hello ensign, there won't be any celebrations here, HC is arranging something someplace else. While we wait for the preparations to be made, I need you to go and make sure our new fighter pilot's quarters are cleaned out and ready for new users, I sent some cleaners there before, make sure they do their job. Dismissed"
<br>
<br><i>Tax turned his back and faced another pilot. They spoke as they made their way towards the hangar.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i> Raul nodded to Gene as the last of the bridge officiers left, then he spoke softly...there was concern in his voice, but it wasn't about what one might think...</i>
<br>
<br>"Yes...an interesting turn, but, that's not why I am here Gene. It's...well, it's you. I...awoke from my nap when something inside you flared...so strongly that even I could feel it...and we both know I am a novice at best along this path. Have you had a chance to speak with your Master yet?"
<br>
<br><i>Raul was watching him with those eyes...ones that seemed to pick up on a lot...catch cheaters, shady dealings...and always let them slide. He continued...</i>
<br>
<br>"I am a little worried. But then again, you figured that out, didn't you. Is there something I can do to help?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
Aye, well Raul, you maybe a novice, but, you will feel the force.  You may not be able to understand it perfectly, but in time you will.  and as if I have talked to my master.  To be truthful, I have not seen him for many months.  That sith really got me to me when he talked about killing Destavol..but...I don't believe that happened..I still feel him in the force...but fading everyday....but aye, no, I must face this as a man and overcome this burden, as you will someday Raul.  Heard HC is going to be throwing some kind of celebration, so, you better get prepped for that and such.  Anything else?
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Raul looked to Gene, the corellian seeming to sense something else...no, not with the Force, but with...his normal senses. He then shook hish ead a little, and spoke...</i>
<br>
<br>"I am not much for stuffy banquets, or whatnot...mind if I be excused from it? I wanted to talk with the remaining pilots in my squad anyways...and share the memories of our lost comrades. I also wanted to give them a funeral of sorts...no one deserves to die in space without it being known of their deeds."
<br>
<br><i>It was as serious as he got. He usually cracked jokes, or tried to ease the tension a little, but with this, he was deadly serious. He didn't expect to be let off the proverbial hook, but he had to ask, anyways.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
Request denied to be excused Raul, you will go, then afterwards may share with your remainding pilots what all happened and such..Funeral services will be conducted tommorrow as well.  If there isn't anything else.  You can be dismissed
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Raul nodded once as Gene finished, grumbling in his mind about the decision. He absoutely -hated- being a part of this kind of thing...he prefered the solace and quiet of a private room. Of course, now, that was a moot point. He spoke in a soft voice to Gene as he began to turn...</i>
<br>
<br>"As you wish sir. If you will excuse me...?"
<br>
<br><i>He bowed his head a little, then turned, and made his way off the bridge. he had to go get ready for this banquet. He hated it...did I mention he hates  formal gatherings?</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
Look at it this way, I don't want to have to dress up formal either. So...your not the only one in that boat...
<br>
<br><i>would chuckle as he saluted and sat back down, pulling out his datapad as he began to look through some stuff...accessing the endor base's database as he did alittle research, before putting it down and sighing</i>
<br>
<br>Aye...Master Destavol...sure wish you was here....One moment where I'm baffled about something....
<br>
<br><i>shaking his head as he would arrise on up and proceed on out of the bridge, nodding to the personell coming back in</i> 
<br>
<br>Better get ready for something the HC might throw...

<i>High Admiral Horn was waiting on a hangar on the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar. It was the only room big enough for so many guests from all the ships. He didn't like the idea, giving all the promotions and merits here instead of having a ceremony on Coruscant, when the mission would have been accomplished, but he wasn't sure how long this campaign would take. This could be the only pause the may have in the next weeks.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile Grand Admiral Simons shuttle had reached Coruscant. A couple of officers in Imperial uniforms welcomed Michael when the shuttle landed in one of the hangars. Michaels report to the naval high command should be on the next day, so he had some time to handle some things before.</i>
<br>
<br>"Admiral Simon." <i>A commander saluted in front of Michael when he left the shuttle.</i> "Admiral Taggle whishes to speak to you. I'll show you the way."

<br>
<br>Sir, we've been sent that the celebration is to concur on the Bulwark, shall I begin getting personell transferred there?
<br>
<br>Aye, I want on my shuttle myself, Raul, and the various Suqad and Vice squad commanders

<i>Raul had gotten ready in quick fashion, having washed off, and gotten things ready while he waited. His R-unit had put itself to the task of getting his dress uniform out, and while he toweled off, he looke dit over. It had changed somewhat since he had come here...a quick rise in the ranks...a few medals...nothing that any junior officier couldn;t do, with a little bit of luck, and some skill behind it. He began getting dressed, smirking a little as it was tight on him...he could breath and move normally...just not as loose as he liked. He'd have to have that altered. He thought to bring his blaster, just in case, but decided against it. Feeling almost naked without it, he shook his head. Soon, he'd be working on how to construct a lightsaber...or so he hoped. But that was a weapon...he needed to learn the defensive arts first, before he went into battle tactics. Pulling his dress jacket down, he made his way into the hallway, his comlink beeping as he stepped forth...</i>
<br>
<br>"Commander Starwind wishes you to fly to the banquet with him in his shuttle...report to hangar bay 1. Bridge out."
<br>
<br><i>Raul nodded to the invisible person, and stuffed the comlink back inside the pocket of his dress pants. He made his way towards the hangar bay.</i>

<i>would be sitting aboard his shuttle, looking as Raul and some of the other officers came aboard as he smiled and nodded</i>
<br>
<br>Aye..know you guys hate dressing up as much as I do..but...when the HC asks to, you know we've got to.  After the celebration, We'll plan for funeral services to be made for our fallen, but, let us keep that thought to the side while we're here, alright?  This is our RnR period, not a time to be worrying.The time for rememberance will come, as, I do not forget any officer who serves under me.
<br>
<br>Got it men?

<i>Tax had recently finished his shower when his comlink beeped.</i>
<br>
<br>"Captain, crew transfers are in progress. Your shuttle is waiting in the hangar, all Squadron Commanders are there as you ordered. Comm out"
<br>
<br><i>Tax nodded before he got dressed, ceremonial uniform, he glanced himself in the mirror before leaving. The Predator was almost empty, the usually crowded corridors was empy and quiet. Leaving the Predator empty wasn't such a good idea.</i>
<br>
<br>"Bridge, before you go to the shuttle, make sure all exits are locked and seal all doors. I want the Predator locked up nice and tight. Can't be too careful with all these spies sneaking around. Send all droids out to patrol the corridors, and don't be late for the celebrations. Captain Out."
<br>
<br>"Affirmative Captain."
<br>
<br><i>Tax reached the hangar, it too was very quiet, the shuttle was standing there with the Squadron Commanders outside, wearing their ceremonial uniforms. They saluted when Tax approached, Tax returned the salute.</i>
<br>
<br>"Good to see you all here, the celebrations are going to start soon so let's all get onboard."
<br>
<br><i>They all entered the shuttle which left shorty after.</i>
<br>
<br>"Now, you will recieve files of your new pilots as soon as I've looked them over. The new fighters are arriving here shortly and there will be time for you to inspect them. Funeral Service will be held tomorrow morning in the hangar. I know we've all lost good men, friends and soldiers but I want you as my Squadron Commanders to keep your head high and spare those feelings until tomorrow. Are there any questions?"
<br>
<br>"No Captain, not at the moment."

<br>
<br>Aye Raul, when we get back, we'll conduct our own funeral service...I don't know if they taught you guys in the academy..but..when I was an imperial, when we lost men out in space, we returned back and had everyone apart of our group fly out in missing man formation and fly around the ship 3 times while someone played taps...would you want to put this in the funeral service?

<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind</p>

<i>Raul looked to Gene, lost in his own thoughts, and he spoke softly...it was obvious his mind was elsewhere, trying to get things put together in places.</i>
<br>
<br>"What...oh yeah, whatever you think is best Commander."
<br>
<br><i>He took in a few breaths, trying to calm himself. He felt nervous as hell...it was one thing to escort a shittle...it weas quite another to have a banquet with all the brass nearby. Onew mistake, and you'd be branded for life...something a pilot couldn't afford.</i>

<i>Tax came to the hangar, there were people everywhere. All in ceremonial uniforms and speaking to eachother. When Tax entered the hangar some people who was standing closest to him turned quiet and looked at Tax.</i>
<br>
<br>"Congratulations on your victory Captain!"

<br>"Thank you, but we're not out of this yet."
<br>
<br>"Well done Captain, where's Commander Starwind?"
<br>
<br>"I expect him to arrive shortly"
<br>
<br>"I heard about your fight with the Imperials, well done Captain, brilliant victory, I must congratulate Commander Starwind when he arrives. I heard he almost lost but managed to turn the tide and win."
<br>
<br>"It looked dark there for a second but we managed to turn the course, we had more trouble with fighters, outlaws, you know, rouge bandits."
<br>
<br><i>Tax was overwhelmed by everyone congratulating him. He couldn't recongnize most of them, Tax frequently looked at the entrance, waiting for Gene to arrive. He wanted to know how he was.</i>

<p class="text">
<i>High Admiral Horn stepped to a micropone infront of him. He was looking over the officers in the hangar. Maybe 200 persons were in the room, maybe more. It was too diffucult looking for someone special. The visitors became  silent when he took the microphone.</i>
<br>
<br>"Well thanks everyone for attending. Before the celebration starts I would like to mention some things. This all looks like we have won a great battle against the empire and celebrating our victory now, ... to be true, we are standing at the beginning of the campaign. The Imperial fleet is still out there. They were the reason we have evacuated A-731, they are the reason for the sabotage on the ISD Immortal, and they are the reason the orbital platform we should protect got destroyed and ... we didn't even do a single shot on them till now. So celebrate now, but be aware, the real battle lies ahead."
<br>
<br><i>The High Admiral made a small pause before he continued...</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
"I give the word to Captain Mattias Gustafsson."
<br>
<br><i>High Admiral Horn stepped back. Captain Mattias Gustafsson stepped forward.</i>
<br>
<br>"What High Admiral Horn says is true, though we have won one victory we still have many more ahead of us. We still have very much to do. However, we have clearly shown our strength. We have revealed that the Imperial Fleet are in league with the pirates, we have shown that we will not tolerate the Imperial opression, we have shown that we will not stand aside and let Imperial forces threaten those under our protection. We're gonna fight them and in the end, We are going to PREVAIL!"
<br>

<br>
<br>Aye, Good to see you in person Captain Tax...was getting frustrating communciating in messages heh....

<br>
<br>Men, Women of the Republic.  Today is a day that we fast in victory.  Times looked bleaked for both our ships, but with the courage, strength, and keeping faith towards the Force, we prevailed through the darkness the Pirates and the Imperials had set forth. Continue we shall to prove to the Imperials they are nothing but flies in our way and that we are truely the hunters, not the Prey of their insignificant ways!

<i>High Admiral started to continue the speach after some of the field commanders made their speaches. At the point where he mentioned that the first of the guests started sleeping he made a break in his speach and started giving out the promotions. After the promotions for some of the officers in the High Command, Vice Admiral Benjamin Simon was kinda irritated on getting Republican admiral signs. He continued with Captain Mattias Gustafsson.</i>
<br>
<br>"Captain Gustafsson, please step ahead."
<br>
<br><i>Rear Admiral Psylor gave Tax a wodden box and opened it. A Commodore Emblem was in.</i>
<br>
<br>"For heroical sevice for the New Republic Captain Mattias Gustafsson gets hereby promoted to Commodore. The Commodore has seved in the ranks of a Captain for some time now and leading the Predator and his wing to several victories over pirates and Imperial remants. The last victory against the pirates that broke our support routes were just one more reason to promote this officer into the ranks of the admirality. Congrats Tax."
<br>
<br><i>Corran was shaking Tax hands, then he returned to his place.</i>
<br>
<br>"Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind, please step ahead."
<br>
<br><i>Psylor gave Gene a box with Commander emblems.</i>
<br>
<br>"For heroical service for the New Republic Lieutenant Commander Gene Starwind is hereby promoted to Commander. The Commander did a great service as Carrier Captain of the Warspite. Even in his junior rank he shown pretty soon his talents as captain of a Mon Calamarie Cruiser and made ship within no time to one of the best ships in the battlegroup, maybe in the fleet. It's a great honor for me to promote an officer that brought so much honor upon battlegroup Zentar. Congrats Gene."

<br>"For heroical service for the New Republic Lieutenant Commander Soniv Hope is hereby promoted to Commander. The Commander has served in his rank for some time now and often shown his qualities and technican and pilot on the ISD Immortal. He recently helped to to repair the ISD Immortal and uncovert reasons for the sabotage. He also helped us much finding out where the Imperial started their campaign. An exellent service for the fleet Commander, congrats.
<br>
<br><i>Corran quickly gave Soniv a hand.</i>
<br>
<br>"Lieutenant Raul Jaknae, please step ahead."
<br>
<br><i>Psylor gave Raul his box when he came infront of him.</i>
<br>
<br>"For heroical service for the New Republic Lieutenant Raul Jaknae is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander. The Commander shown his piloting skills pretty often in the last time, especially in the assault on A-708, but he also shown his talents in commanding his officers as squadron commander. His deeds are one of the reasons the carrier groups managed to complete their task sucessfully. I guess that's the start of a great career in the Ner Republican Navy, congrats Commander."

<br>
<br>"Ensign Lucius, please step ahead."
<br>
<br><i>Psylor quickly gave Lucius the box with his new rank emblems.</i>
<br>
<br>"For heroical service for the New Republic Lucius is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant. Just fresh from the Academy the Lieutenant impressed us all with his piloting skills, his heroical attetude and his extraordinary service for the New Republican navy. Its a honor for me being the first one giving Lucius his new ranking emblems in his hopefully long career in the New Republican navy. Congrats Lieutenant."

<i>Raul was quite surprised by the promotion, and as he looked to Tax, he smirked a little, but said nothing about it. He would put the new rank insignias on in his quarters later...after the funeral cerimony. He didn't feel right in doing so before he let his squads mourn properly. He bowed his head to the Admiral as he tucked the case away inside his dress pants, and looked around. He...felt awkward, especially being singled out, even for a promotion. However, he was going to slowly get used to it. He moved off towards an area not so populated with people, against a back wall, watching various things...where he could handle people one at a time, should they wish to speak with him.</i>

<br>
<br>"Here we are, have a seat."
<br>
<br><i>Tax went to the cockpit and lifted the ramp up so noone could get into the shuttle. Tax then sat down infront of Gene.</i>

<br>"Well, I would like to know more about this Sith you encountered. I'd hate to face you when you're not around. However if I do, or my men do. I would like them to know what would be best to do."

Learn to resist the darker powers of the force...because they will indeed use those to axchieve what they want, a good slice in half by their double sabers...I cannot give you much on how to fight a Sith..just...watch, they are also extremely flexible and nimble...basically fighting force with force if you want to know the truth...I felt the coldest I've ever been when I was barely near it....and that wasn't cool...

"No of course not, but I just wanted to know what to do if I encounter one. Anyway, thought we could have funeral services together. I mean, we fought together, died together and won together. Wouldn't be more than right to have funeral services together. Tell me what you think."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
I'll have to ask my men that Tax.  If they wish to do a joint, then, I wouldn't mind, but if they wish to do their own, then, I go with my men, not againist them on something like death.  Good advice....if you feel something awkard, get the hell away.

<br>
<br>"As I said Commander, the choice is yours. The ship is yours, as are the men that were lost. I am not going to make it for you. Is there anything else sir? If not, I think I will ask for a shuttle back to the Warspite...turn in for the evening."

After the celebrations are over, Lieutenant Commander, currently the ship is under lock down till I give the access code to unlock the attack droids onboard, only things allowed to go to and fro are the supply transports in a designated safe hangar currently almost full.  You can either take this as an order or a suggestion...
<br>
<br><i>Gene would hand Raul a bottle of Corellian Whiskey</i>
<br>
<br>Take you a few shots Raul, Your're as angry as I am about losing men....and form what I've been seeing going on, we'll be fighting some more......eh....take a seat.....I've got a story to tell you....
<br>
<br><i>Gene would sit down in the corner in a chair as his hand slowly rose a seat pulling over near him</i>
<br>
<br>My last few months on the Imperial Side, I was transferred over to a specops division due to my....unloyalness to my Wing Commander for previous actions she did to a few rebel prisoners.....basically the division I was transferred to...did near to impossible suicide missions for disloyalment....well...We were dropped off to set charges to a republican base....heh....let's just say that never happened, we mutinied againist the Commander who tried to push us to do it...so......me and 5 others bailed and went into the desert, three of which died because we were used to jungles and forests...not deserts...Aye, they were good men just like the ones we had....the point of my story is...that as a soldier...that is what your trained to do, go on and try to remember those men who didn't make it....never letting their memory die so others will know what they did to sacrifice for the cause for peace.
<br>
<br><i>Gene would down for a moment, taking a drink from his corellian whiskey before looking back up</i>
<br>
<br>I've been a soldier for over 10 years.  You just get use to it, but you enjoy the moments while your with them.

<i>Raul took a drink of the whiskey, not bothering with a glass, and he spoke in a soft voice...his own pain being shown in the vocalization of his words...</i>
<br>
<br>"Commander...nice as that story was, I have lost many too. I usually get close to those who I have to trust my life to. Being in the Warspite is something entirely different than being in space, or on the field. If you don;t trust the pilots who can and will be on your wing, you have nothing...and you will end up space dust. Each of those men I helped train...and were trained with me. Each of them died under my command. No matter what I hear, or say, I feel responsible for their deaths. If I had been there to keep that fighter off their back, or to keep the stormtrooper from firing off that blast...maybe it would have been them celebrating today with the rest of us...being promoted and getting the medals...instead of awaiting a funeral launch from the docking bay. So, no offense Commander...but it is different."
<br>
<br><i>He sighed softly, then shook his head, and took another swig of the correlian whiskey. He continued...</i>
<br>
<br>"I shouldn;t have gone off on you...sorry. Sometimes I don't think people actually listen or care. It takes some yelling or brow-beating to get some people to get the point."

<i>Michael was standing in a conference hall in the naval headquarter on coruscant. He had already solved the hearing at the naval command and the second one with the senators. His reports had been made and he was just on the way back to the fleet when he got called to this meeting.
<br>Admiral Noras was standing in front of a holoprojector that was displaying the sector of the galaxy when the 5th fleet was operation:</i>
<br>
<br>"Well yesterday Admiral Drovens fleet had an encounter with the fleet of Admiral Sagendon, one of Lord Horus commanders. Sagendon had big losses but managed to push Droven back. Droven managed to remove his fleet after he lost two calamarie cruisers. He is currently withdrawing deeper into Republican space, cause his fleet isn't able to do another battle.
<br>On the other edge of the Sector we have lost the Nebulon-B Frigate Etmon Fogoldier. Intel thinks of the Terror Class Superstardestroyer Hermes. So Rear Admiral Takkles will be withdrawn from the sector within days, when the station they protect got fully evacuated. Battlegroup Astoria had already left the sector.
<br>Horus is taking the sector from two sides, so you should withdraw you fleet too, Simon."
<br>
<br>"Affirmative Sir. We're collecting our forces somewhere to build a defense line against Horus?"
<br>
<br>"Not at the moment. We give Horus same space to expand so he has to spread his fleets over the territories. And when your fleet and the others are back to full battlestrength we'll attack the parts of Horus fleets.
<br>We cannot collect all our forces in the area for a single decision battle. Even when Horus joines the battle, we may have high losses, and those ships we may loose will be missed against the other warlords."
<br>
<br>"I understand, sir. It's maybe better waiting to see a bit more of Horus plans before reacting. Nevertheless, till now Horus was less interested on controlling large areas of low populated Outer Rim territories.
<br>Well requesting permissing to leave as soon as possible to be with my fleet when they are leaving the sector."
<br>
<br>"Permission granted. Well Simon, you have a few days left before Admiral Takkles leaves, should be enough time to handle your operations in the sector."
<br>
<br><i>A few moments later Michael was stading in a holo room establishing a connection to High Admiral Horn via a Hypercommunication line. After a few seconds a holographic Image of Corran appeared in the room.</i>
<br>
<br>"Corran, we have got the orders to withdraw from the sector. To or more fleets from Admiral Horus are taking the sector from two lines. Orders are to fall back till we see a a week point in Horus lines."
<br>
<br>"Falling back now? The fleet is pretty upset on what happened in the last time and would like to pay some things back to the imps."
<br>
<br>"Thought that myself. Well we are to week to challange Horus entire force and can't risk to get isolated from the Republic in case we remain in the sectore. But we could give Horus at least a bloody nose. I'm pretty sure Horus has a base of opperations near aurora. You could send some reconissaince Y-Wings to the systems near aurora. I'm pretty sure the base is located there."
<br>
<br>"Will do Mike."
<br>
<br>"By the Way, Corran. Have the losses during the battles been replaced?"
<br>
<br>"Not completely. The empire did good, destroying our supply depots. We got only half of the reinforcements we needed and even less of the other supplies. I'm a bit scared on the low amount of warheads we have."
<br>
<br>"I'll see what I can do, but I doubt the command gives me a convoi for the unsafe area the fleet is in. I'll take the next ship that heads to the fleet. See you soon, Corran."
<br>
<br>"Till then, Mike."

<i>The Y-Wing had reached the Helmsduster system, close to the Aurora system. The Pilot noticed pretty soon, that there was a couple of communication within the system. He need a few minutes to configurate the long range radar and analysed the system. A couple of Imperial IFF codes were displayed on his screen. He encrypted the radar scans, sent them back to the Zentar and was about to start into hyperspace when a laser bolt hit the Y-Wing. Shields were down to 80 percent. He soon noticed 3 fighters behind him, as if they would have come out of nowhere. He tried to increase speed to be able to escape into hyperspace. A couple of laser bolts were hitting one of his engines. The bomber started to shake immediatly. The pilot looked behind seeing one of the engine breaking off the Y-Wing. Shields were down, missle systems offline, engines down, the power support was dropping and a small light with eject on was starting too glow. The pilot pressed the button and the pilot capsule was shot off the remnants of the bomber. </i>

<p class="text">
<i>Michael, Corran and a few other officers were standing in the center of the main conference hall of the Zentar while a couple of other commanders were sitting on the places arounf them. The holoprojector in the middle of the hall was displaying a tactical map.</i>
<br>
<br>"Ladies, gentlemen, we have got the order to withdraw from the sector. The Remnant warlord Horus has taken several key places in the borders of the sector so the Republic needs to regroup its forces within own territories before starting to fight against the warlord.
<br>But before we leave this sector, I would like to give Lord Horus a bloody nose. We managed to locate Horus base of opperations within the sector. It's an older Imperial starfortress, placed in the Helmsduster system. It's kinda indestructable, at least with the resources we have, so we aren't going do destroy it.
<br>The starfortress has 3 sections. The inner core consists of the energy core, the bunker and the reseve systems like the reserve repulsor engine. The mid sector consists of the crew quarters, hospital, life support and all this stuff, finally the hull senction, bigger then the two other sections together. It contains the command bridge, weapon and shield systems. Large hangars and storage bays and the docking ring. Each section is protected from its neigboring sections with a several meters thick armor.
<br>The main plan is to destroy enough of the hull section to make it very cost intensive to repair it. It's tactically better, when Horus spends a lot of reasources, personnel and time into restoration of the base then when he puts the same resources into his campaign against the Republic. Sure he can still drop the station but that would be simiar as if we would have destroyed it our own.
<br>So our main task is to destroy the bridge of the fortress as well as the docking ring. Much of the storage sections should be destroyed, cause we beleave Horus has stored alot of the fuel, ammunition, food, water and all kind of other supplies there, he needs for the campaign. Weapon systems and hangers should be the secondary targets. We could leave the place without destroying them, but eliminating the hangars and laser turrets surely will make the mission easier for us. Tertiary target is everything with an Imperial IFF code so as much as possible need to be destroyed from the fortress and the defending fleet.
<br>The plan for the attack will be the following. The bomber squadrons of the Battlegroups Hunter and Zentar will leave the hangars together with some fighter squadrons as escort. Then the fleet jumps to Helmsduster and leaves hyperspace in mid distance to the fortress. Last time we have seen 2 VSDs defending the fortress, but meanwhile the Remnant know, that we know where their base is and they have increased their forces at other parts of the sector too, so we think they have already increased the forces defending the fortress. Nevertheless most of these forces will surely move against us, seeing the entire 5th fleet leaving hyperspave.
<br>Then the bombers with escorts should leave the hyperspace pretty close to the fortress. I know it's dangerous leaving hyperspace such close to a big structure, even for a small bomber and fighter, but it's the best chance for giving the station a bigger strike. The squadrons will drop 80% of their weapon load, and return to the fleet. On their way they can attack the Remnant fleets that are encountering us from behind.
<br>Everything further will be decided on the battlefield, depending on the situation and the strength of the Remnant forces.
<br>The opperation starts within days, and only voluteers will take part. Everyone else can return to coruscant with the freighter convois. The commanders that wasn't able to attend to the meeting get a holodisk with the informations. The informations shouldn't be transmitted via comm channels before the operation starts.
<br>Commander Otton will continue with the unit details now. Thanks everyone for listening and may the force be with you."

<br>
<br>Will we have any escort ships, such as gunships or corvettes to keep small fighters off the capitol ships?  Since our fighters are going to be busy with the bombers or the other capitol ships?

<p class="text">
<i>Commander Otton pressed a button to change the display and a tactical view of the formation of the 5th fleet came clear.</i>
<br>
<br>"Well, the ISDs Hamburg and Immortal with their escort ships will cover the flanks. Their fighters and bombers aren't hyperspaceable. So they will be launshed after the arrival to defend the fleet and attack the possible opponent fleet. Like Admiral Simon mentioned, just some fighter squadrons will escort the bomber squadrons. We hope to get opponent ships attacking us, so the bombers wouldn't need so much defense for their first run on. If the situation isn't clear for the bombers before they arrive, we can still send additional fighters to cover them. So I guess each ship will have at least one two fighter squadrons remaining for the securing the ship. The defenses may be not enough in case we ran into an entire Imperial armada, but we are just not sure how strong the oppenent forces in the system are. For the escort ships of Battlegroup hunter I have to check my notices ..."

<br>"Roger that, the Predator will take part in the attack if we get the ship and crew together. I don't have that much bombers, however, I have 3 fighter squadrons ready at disposal. I have 1 light bomber squadron. Is it possible to infiltrate the station? I have 2 commando units aboard my ship. If possible, we could plant explosives at the station's fueldepo which would cause a great explosion. That'd cripple it."

<i>Commander Otton switched to hologram to the normal display again.</i>

<br>We stay in each case out of the station. Besides the 2 divisions of stormtroopers that guard the station we don't have the time for invading the station. Remember it may take days if we land ground forces and fight from one side of a floor to another side. Even with commando units it takes too long even if they have sucess.

This old hunk of junk proved it's worth againist some, so, no need worrying.

<i>Wolverine and Aldwyn met back up with Gene after the Grand Admiral told them to search out the sith leads. They walked in on his hit and run debriefing.</i>
<br>
<br><i>They stood off to the side, not wanting to seem intruding, but not also seeming to not be there, they had an objective to complete. When Gene was finished with his basic overview.</i>
<br>
<br>"No questions here officer, just that times a wasting."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Wolverine</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Then Szudek raised his hand while at attention.</i> "Sir! If our leader of one of our squad dies, do one of the higher ranking pilot in the same squadron take his/her place?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Ensign Szudek Sviatislav</p>
<p class="text">
"Ensign, I will not tollerate such discussions. We're all in the same boat here and going the same way. If the leader dies then the Carrier Captain decides. Now proceed to briefing. Dismissed!"
</p>

<p class="text">
<i>Raul nodded to Gene, then stood up as Gene finished He spoke in a loud voice...his voice ringing over the Warspite's briefing room...</i>
<br>
<br>"Mount up ladies and gentlemen! The modifications should be ready by the time you finish your pre-flight. Happy Hunting, and may the Force be with you."
<br>
<br><i>Raul began to assess each pilot as they began to shuffle out of the room, and kept an eye on them...their demeanor, their look. He reached for his flight helmet, and began to make his way out...last man out of the room, save for Gene, should he stay behind...</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Lieutenant Commander Raul Jaknae</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax joined the pilots in the briefing room. He walked in, now wearing standard uniform and with a serious expression on his face.</i>
<br>
<br>"Settle down pilots. I know most of you haven't even unpacked your things yet but we're getting into action again. Mission is a tactical retreat, we're regrouping the fleet but before that we're gonna attack a station located not too far away. Orders are to cripple it as much as possible since we probably don't have time enough to destroy it."
<br>
<br><i>Tax show the same hologram Gene used.</i>
<br>
<br>"This is the target, an heavily armoured Imperial Fortress. Primary targets are these sections"
<br>
<br><i>Tax points at various hull sections.</i>
<br>
<br>"Meaning of this is to buy time and make the enemy waste resources on repairs which gives us a small advantage. The problem is that we don't know how well defended it is. So we're going in full force, bombers with escorts drop out of hyperspace close to the station and drop 80% of their load and then head back to the ship. For us, Beryl will be protected by Cobalt. Crimson and Auric remains behind to defend the fleet or reinforce Cobalt. For new comers, stay with you wingman and remember you training, listen to your superiors and for God sakes don't be a hero, stay frosty. Are there any questions?"
<br>
<br><i>Tax looked at his pilots.</i>
<br>
<br>"Lieutenant Lucius, is everything clear? Lieutenant Svatislav? The rest of you?"
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
Aye, you heard your WC.  You are dismissed!  May the force be with you...and Raul, hold up a second...
<br>
<br><i>waiting for the pilots to walk on out, catching Raul before he left</i>
<br>
<br>Same tactical format from last time, alright?  See if you can get your men to complte all tasks.
<br>
<br><i>saluting to him as he looked towards Wolverine</i>
<br>
<br>Aye, will you be flying that 2400 into battle Knight Wolverine or do you want a fighter or bomber?
<br>
<br><i>getting onto the PA again through the warspite</i>
<br>
<br>This is Commander Star, all crew to your battlestations, I repeat, Battlestations, we are going to code red in t-minus 5 minutes, I want a systems check from every deck before we hit hyperspace

"Yes,sir. Everything understood." <i>Szudek said with bravery. Even though, this was his first battle ever. Then Szudek tried to sneak into a corner with out anyone knowing. A few tears came out while thinking if he was going to die. As soon he reached the dark corner, he fell to his knees. AS moment or two later, he came back and said,</i> "May I pray to protect us all in the heat of battle? <i>He asked tax, but he was already starting the prayer,</i>
<br>
<br>"O, mighty Lord, I pray that You will be my shield
<br>As I do battle against ignorance, cruelty and injustice.
<br>Through Your unending love,
<br>I will pray thet You will diliver me from my enemies,
<br>And that You will grant me goodness and steadfastness,
<br>So that I might lead others to do your will
<br>And glotify Your name.
<br>Amen.
<br>

<i>Grand Admiral Simon and High Admiral Horn were standing one the bridge of the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar.</i>
<br>
<br>"It's about time." <i>Michael noticed, then he walked to one of the communications officers.</i> "Lieutenant, send the following message to the fleet:
<br>Well the time for the battle has come. In 10 minutes the hyperspaceable bombers and the escort fighter should leave the hangars. 5 minutes later the capitol ships should hyperjump from A-749 to a location 5 kilometers away from the fortress. Two minutes later the bomber squadrons with escorts should jump from A-749 to a position 1 kilometer away from the fortress.
<br>When we arrive there we should be able to attract most of the fleet defending the fortress. The Bombers migth arrive 10 minutes later, cause of the slower hyperengines, they will attack the station, when the shield is down, they will attack weapon system, bridge, doncking bay hangar and storage bays. The fleet can't get closer to the fortress before shields and the bigger gun turrets of the station got destroyed.
<br>Further Orders will follow on the battlefield. Return point is the A-749 system, where we are now. I case the plan don't changes we will meet there after the battle again and return to Republican space from there.
<br>At the end of the mission those party is the winner with the lowest losses. So follow the plan, no extratours and what is most important, try to stay alive. Whatever happens today, it won't be the last battle against Lord Horus.
<br>Well, finally, ... may the force be with you."

<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax listened to Szudek prayer, it was a beautiful one.</i>
<br>
<br>"Beautiful Szudek, I have nothing against such things. Let me let you in on a little Predator thing, our motto: 'Fraternitas, Victoria'. It means 'brotherhood and victory' you won't be alone up there. The whole fleet will be there."
<br>
<br><i>Tax saw that Szudek didn't feel very well.</i>
<br>
<br>"Listen to me, find strength and victory is ours. Good luck up there! May the Force be with you. Go now and carry your head high, you're battlegroup Hunter now."
<br>
<br><i>Tax recieved the message from Simon, he ran to the bridge after sending his pilots to the hangar wishing them good luck. He didn't like the feeling to send out fresh pilots into a battle such as this but he couldn't back out now.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>would proceed onward after hearing wolverine's decision and such, going to the bridge, he'd nod and sit down in his revolving chair</i>
<br>
<br>Sir, incoming message from the Grand Admiral
<br>
<br>Put it on the loudspeaker to the hangar
<br>
<br> we are to launch bombers and escorts in 10 minutes, then we are suppose to jump 5 minutesd after that to a distance5 clicks away, while 2 minutes after that the bombers and escort should hit hypwerspace and reach 1 click away from the station, primary target is to bring the shields down, then commence runs on the weapon systems, bridge, docking bay hangar and storage bays.  Return point is this sector.  May the force be with you

<p class="text">
<i>Wolverine smiled.</i> "My ship of course, its been known to take a beating or two in its day."
<br>
<br><i>Both Jedi listened into the Admirals orders and headed for their ship, saying good luck to Gene and the others.
<br>
<br>Wolverine started the system check and Aldwyn grabbed a spare pilot to help man the lower rotating turret while he manned the top one. They wanted to make sure they didn't make any mistakes.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Captain Wolverine</p>
<p class="text">
"Yes,sir! Alright men! Hurry before our plan is ruined!" <i>Szudek yelled after giveing a final salute to tax. He ran like there was no tommorow, running along with other men who are getting ready to attack as well. When he got into the hanger, he jumped in his assigned A-Wing, but he took the raido and asked the control tower,</i> "Am I clear to take off?"
</p>

<i>Lucius walked to his ship and cracket his neck looking out for younger pilots.</i>
<br>
<br>"Prayer, how more foolish can you get?" <i>he smirked</i> "Ah well, thats humans for you"
<br>
<br><i>As the young Zabrak got into his A-Wing he reported to Tax</i>
<br>
<br>"Sir, My team is in position, we are ready to take off"
<br>
<br><i>The Leutenant laid back and lit a cigarette.</i> "So it begins" <i>he smiled.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Second Lieutenant Lucius</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Szudek immediatly took the intercom to other ships that are just to go into battle, but he turned it on so tax could hear.</i> "Alright guys, along with our motto;'Fraternitas, Victoria', here is one that will remain in our hearts for the rest of our lifes in war!" <i>Then he said with confidence,</i> We all dodge together, We all come home together! Is everyone with us?! If so, lets show our friends what happens when they mess with us!" <i>His A-Wing levitated in the air and slowly departed from the dock.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Ensign Szudek Sviatislav</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Tax reached the bridge and got his transmissions from the hangar.</i>
<br>
<br>"Give them launch permissions."
<br>
<br><i>Tax sat down in the command chair.</i>
<br>
<br>"All men to battlestations, prepare the ship for hyperspace as soon as the fighters has cleared the hangar. Change to Red Alert and give me a report on all systems"
<br>
<br><i>Tax recieved the transmission from Gene.</i>
<br>
<br>"Send back the following: Don't worry Gene, you have a bad feeling on every mission we do, something always does sideways. Try to find a position close to me and we'll  help eachother, may the Force be with you Gene. End Transmission"
<br>
<br><i>Tax stood up and went to the windows. He looked at the Fleet gathering and all the fighters getting ready for hyperspace. It asn't long until the attack would begin.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Mattias Gustafsson</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Before Szudek put his ship completly out of the hanger, he waited the permision for launching so he could speed right into action.</i> One-We will have nothing less than a full victory. And two- Never leave a commrade behind." <i>Szudek said with a bit of anger in his tone.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Ensign Szudek Sviatislav</p>
<p class="text">
<i>Raul was already inside his X-Wing...mostly repaired after their last firefight...minus some torpedoes, of course. He grinned to himself, speaking first through the comm to the rest of his flight mates...</i>
<br>
<br>"Stay with your escorts folks...they are counting on us to keep the fighters and whatever else is out there at bay. Sing out your targets, and hit 'em hard. May the Force be with you."
<br>
<br><i>Raul flicked his comm now to his R-unit, and he spoke to his friend...</i>
<br>
<br>"Let me know if any of the newbies need help. I am going to be playing rover, just in case. I don't want to lose ay mor epilots than we have to...not again. We just finished sending some of our comrades out...let's nto give them anymore company than we have to."
<br>
<br><i>HIs R-unit beeped to him woefully, as the launch signal was given. He grinned, and hit the repulsorlifts, taking his ship out of the hangar, and into space once more. As he did so, so did the rest of his wing...a fluid, efficient deployment.</i>

<i>Michael was looking out of the window and seen the bomber and fighter squadrons leaving the ships and going in positions for the hyperjump. Michael quickly checked the tactical screen. The TCSSD Angel of Death was taking the lead. The ISDs Hamburg XII and Immortal the left and right side of the fleet. Usually Michael preferred to have the ASD Prometheus in lead cause of the better maneuverability of the smaller ship, but the Angel of Death should do too. As SSD it should be pretty strong in close combat and the shield should be able to absorb some damage from the attacking ships and bombers. He still didn't have a good feeling on this. He didn't like the idea of giving up the sector without even a single fight against the Remnants, but Horus surely would expect them commining. This battle would be decided by the pilots and gunners and soldies more then by the admirals. Michael turned to the communication officer.</i>
<br>
<br>"Commander, start the coundown for the hyperjump."
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Grand Admiral Michael Simon</p>

<br><i>Tax was still standing at the windows, he saw the massive fleet gathering up with fighter and bomber squadrons flying everywhere, the Angel of Death was forming up and the Hamburg and Immortal was covering the flanks.</i>
<br>
<br>"Helm, take us slightly above and behind the Angel and prepare for hyperspace."
<br>
<br>"Alright pilots, you have your orders, see you at the other side. May the Force be with you."
<br>
<br>"Send word to Admiral Simon, Predator is fully operational and ready to commence the attack."
<br>
<br><i>Tax's heart was pounding, preparing for battle from a bridge was different but exciting nevertheless. The clock was ticking, it was almost time.</i>
</p>
<p class="author" align="right">Commodore Mattias Gustafsson</p>

<i>The Zentar entered the hyperspace and the stars started to drift across the windows. It took awile till the Zentar had left hyperspace again.
<br>The 5th fleet was in formation when the Imperial remant identified them on the radar. 3 ISDs, 2 VSDs, 1 Interdictor, 2 Nebulon B frigates and around two dozend smaller ships in the size of a corvette were leaving the area around the starfortress and moved towards the 5th fleet.
<br>The Imperial fleet was starting their fighter and bomber squadrons, the 5th fleet did the same with their reserve squadrons. A gigantic wave of TIE Fighters, TIE Bombers and TIE Interceptors was running towards the 5th fleet. 12 squadrons from the 2 5th fleet ISDs as well as the reserves from the other ships started encountering the opponents.
<br>The battle between the two fleets had just started when the bomber squadrons with their escorts left the hyperspace almost in range of the wepon systems of the huge battle station. Hundrets of TIE Fighters were leaving the hangars of the fortress, but the bombers had already started their run.</i>

<br><i>The X-wing took asecond to comply, and as he did, the TIEs, not expecting the maneuver, shot past the afflicted pilot, and Raul's X-wing streaked onto their tail. A second later, his laser cannons came to life, blasting one TIE into space debris. The second began weaving an intricate flight path, trying it's best to lose Raul in amongst the capital ship's exchanges...but with the Force to help guide him, Raul was able to match the complex maneuvers. The TIE made a mistake, zigging when it should have zagged, and Raul got a clean shot. It tore through the cockpit of the TIE, vaporizing the bogey in one instant.
