<p class="textwhite">High Admiral Worf, you are just allowed to show this message to officers who have you complete trust.
<br>Yesterday 3:00 Coruscant time an unidentified Imperial fleet destroyed our fortifications at Opsolon. 2 Golan-2 space stations, the Calamari Cruiser Tengeta, the Light Calamari Cruiser Elvin, The Frigate Heuteres and 5 Corvettes got destroyed. Frigate Zartos Sauron and Corvette Hercules managed to escape Arristotes, where the encoutered an heavy damaged Imperial VSD. Intelligence beleaves it was the VSD Artemis. The VSD managed to escape into hyperspace.
<br>Currently the entire sector is seriously in danger. 70% of our defenses here got destroyed and the Imperials control the most important system in the sector your Battlegroup and Carrier Group Harmony are currently the only remaining operative forces in the area.
<br>I have contacted High Admiral Commskywalker. Battlegroup Zentar is already on the way. ETA in 4 days. Carrier Group Harmony has been ordered to fall back, if nessesary.
<br>Since we currently don't know the anything about the attack at Opsolon, I would suggest to stay alert. If nessesary you should fortify you positions at Fahron, we cannot let the empire proceed to this position. Scouts are on the way to find out the more about the operating Imperial forces. We'll decide if we try to retake Opsolon, when we are at full strengh and the enemy is identified.
<br>
<br>One note, Grand Admiral Simon stopped contact to us. The reason is unknown to the High Command, but the ISD Immortal and the VSD Ratio have been located in the region. From the current point on, you and High Admiral Commskywalker will get your orders directly from me or the senate.
<br>
<br>May the force be with you,
<br>
<br>Admiral Ackbar
</p>
<p class="textwhite"><b>First encounters</b>
<br>
<br>Today Captain Master-Qui-Gon, who was send to Fahron earlier to check the preparations of the local fuel station on the comming Battlegroup Zentar, met with Fleet Admiral Matt Sifi in the Boronia Gas Industries Refeul Station in Orbit of Fahron III. Both officers managed to survive an ambush of two till now unknown humans. Both attackers managed to escape seriously injured, but the DNA analyses of the blood of the officers, shows, they have been clones, a later Imperial production series. Both suspects escaped in a shuttle of the lambda serious.
<br>
<br>As reaction to the incident High Admiral Commskywalker requested more security for the refuel stations, till Carrier Groups Zentar and Hell Raiser arrive their tomorrow. He also honorly mentioned the deeds of FA Matt Sifi and CPT Master-Qui-Gon, who both managed to defend this attack.
<br>
<br>On a special request of Commodore Jennifer Jade, Gorgon squadron of the TCSSD Warlover patrols around the refuel station, to prevent further incidents.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Frontline business</b>
<br>
<br>"You're sure they won't find us here, captain?" Lieutenant Commander Soronir to Captain Meldwin on the bridge of the Corellian Corvette Hercules. "The Zartos Sauron was an easy target to them. If they find us, I'm not sure if we can do a better fight."
<br>"Well, ... you can never be sure, but with some luck, we'll manage it" the captain answered "You have meanwhile analysed what attacked us?"
<br>"Well, looked like imps, can't say much more about it, our scanners just catched space dust."
<br>
<br>The Blocade Runner Hercules and the Nebulon-B Frigate Zartos Sauron had been on the way to Poron to regroup in the other rebel forces in the sector, but the force wasn't with them. Ambushed by unidentified attackers the frigate was soon an expanding cloud of scrap metal. The Hercules manage to micro-jump out of the battlefield and hided in an asteroid field.
<br>
<br>"Sir," Lieutenant Estevan mentioned to Captain Meldwin "we have found something here."
<br>The captain followed Estevan to his terminal, where the shape of a stardestroyer was displayed.
<br>"The optical analysis point on a Vicetory Stardestroyer, pre Yarvin version, kinda damaged, like the reports said, but it's not the Artemis, like Intelligence expected. We are too far away to analyze the VSD witout radar. The only thing we know, is that the VSD is hiding in this asteroid field too."
<br>"Ok Commader Soronir, you have prepared a position for the hyperspace entry."
<br>"Sure."
<br>"OK, proceed to this position, we'll turn on radar when we start moving to prevent his of smaller rocks, you will have a few minutes to get a clear radar scan of th ship then."
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Hidden enemy</b>
<br>
<br>News from Battlegroup Hunter:
<br>
<br>Lieutenant Commander Marcus "Cyrus" Gustavson encountered two enemy fighter on a large scale patrol around Fahron. Both Imperial fighters were TIE Advanced. The Lieutenant Commander was able to escape, after he got hit by an advanced conclussion missle. He was also able to identify a freighter, the Imperials were covering.

<p class="textwhite">Officers of Battlegroup Hunter and Battlegroup Zentar, recent Intelligence news shown, that the entire sector is going to be place of a large scale Imperial invasion. Major Imperial forces of two Imperial warlords have been identified.
<br>Admiral Ocaron moved his main fleet consisting of the ISD Nobility, VSD Superiority, FRG Shield of Bastion, 4 Dreadnoughts of the former Katana fleet and 5 Corellian Corvettes to the Ackzaros star system. The Republican starport on Ackzaros IV had been completely destroyed.
<br>Baron von Zornheim has send more military convois to Agnas Tauto. Intelligence thinks he is preparing his main assault. Meanwhile some of von Zornheims Corvettes have been sent out to gain control of Arristotes and Anfaron. A republican supply convoi with destination Poron has been destroyed in the Anfahron system.
<br>The Republican forces in the sector are down. The Arristotes system has been given up. Nebulon-B Frigate Zartos Sauron has been destroyed, and Modified Corvette Hercules withdrawn to Poron.
<br>The Republican Frigate Seeker and a civillian Corvette have been found destroyed close to the Parethes system.
<br>The Mon Calamarie Cuiser Harmony has been under heavy attack by a squadron of TIE Phantom fighters. It has lost 3 X-Wing squadrons, before the TIE Phantoms withdrawn.
<br>Our current plan is to stabilize the situation. Battlegroup Zentar will move to Poron and will replace the damaged Harmony and Hercules. From there Battlegroup Zentar can have an eye on the systems around. Battlegroup Hunter will stay in Fahron for the moment. The plan is to fortify a defense line from Parethes to Poron to Anfaron untill reinforcements arrive.
<br>
<br>The VSD Artemis from the former briefing has ben identified trough CRV Hercules. It's not the Artemis as expected, it's the VSD Atrodoch, a Republican VSD from Vice Admiral Harkovs former fleet, it has vanished before the battle of Endor. More details arn't known till now.
<br>
<br>The number of sabotage actions on Fahron increased drastically, High Admiral Worf has been ordered to investigate the incidents.
<br>
<br>
<br>Admiral Ackbar
</p>
<p class="textwhite"><b>Lieutenant Commander Gustavsson, Hero of the Day</b>
<br>
<br>Galactic News Network:
<br>
<br>Close to Fahron Lieutenant Commander Marcus Gustavsson rescued a republican transport. A single TIE Phanton had destroyed the 3 X-Wing Fighters escorting a transport with refugees from Opsolon. Gustavson heard the distress call from the transport while he was doing a long range patrol. He encountered the TIE Phantom, but without even optical targeting he had no chance against the enemy fighter, and he used it.  He waited till the enemy fighter was behind him, made some rolls to decrease the distance to the enemy fighter and then he used manouver-trusters to collide with the enemy fighter, both fighters got completely destroyed, but Gustavson managed to escape with the ejector seat. Admiral Ackbar personally honored LCM Gustavson in a speach at the Republican senate and 100 families thanked him in a huge letter.

<p class="textwhite"><b>Intercepted Transmission</b>
<br>
<br>*Salute*
<br>
<br>Admiral Ackbar, this is High Admiral CommSkywalker reporting in. Battlegroup Zentar has arrived at Poron, but all has been quiet since. However, I ordered the CRS Hell Raiser to station itself in space near Parethes, with all systems powered off except its long range scanners. 5 standard hours ago, it intercepted this transmission from what appears to be a nearby Imperial relay base:
<br>
<br>Message Recording
<br>
<br>We are unable to decipher this message, but perhaps investigation of the relay base will turn up more answers? I await your further orders. CommSkywalker out.
<br>
<br>*Salute*
<br>
<br>High Admiral CommSkywalker
<br><br><br>
<br>High Admiral Commskywalker
<br>
<br>(salute)
<br>
<br>exellent done, Admiral. The information of the Imperial relay base may be able to lighten the entire situation.
<br>Well you can try, to break the Imperial code with some of Admiral Hall's agents or if nessesary try to capture the relay base intact, but in at least 3 weeks Parethes need to be cleared from Imperial forces, to prevent them attacking us from behind when we start an assault on Opsolon.
<br>I leave this decision to you, Admiral, I think you have an better overview on your current capacities.
<br>
<br>May the force be with you,
<br>
<br>Admiral Ackbar

<p class="textwhite">Commanders, the Imperial progress in the sector have been stopped temporary.
<br>Battlegroup Hunter managed to destroy one dreadnaught and two corvettes of the Imperial Battlegroup Nobility, but more important is they damaged several Imperial ships, so the frontline forces of Battlegroup Nobility have been removed to the Ackzaros planetary system. It seems Admiral Ocaron changed his plans and is now fortifiing the second planet of the system after the small battles with Battlegroup Hunter.
<br>Battlegroup Zentar meanwhile secured Porom and is increasing Republican control to the frontline systems Anfaron and Parethes. Frigate Dark Sky lately managed to destroy one Imperial Corvette including a squadron of Assault Gunboats defending an Imperial convoi at Anfaron. It also seems that the CRS Hell Raiser identified an Imperial Nexus at Parethes. Details to that on a later date.
<br>Sepheron system seems have been the location for the greatest battle of the last week. The wrecks of the Republican ISD Gigantic and the Republican VSD Impassable have been found, as well the wrecks of the legendary TCSSD Amethyst and about 15 smaller ships. Both Republican capitol ships belonged to the Delasol defense fleet, one of the units under Grand Admiral Simon's command that turned to the Republic. We still exactly what is going on there, but Intel beleaves the Amethyst belonged to the Imperial attack groups.
<br>The Imperial forces in the sector have got a bloody nose now and their progress halted. The first time in the conflict they experianced a real defense, so they will concentrate their forces until they can launch massive assaults on the Remnants of our defenders. The recent attacks haven't really hurt the Imperials, but they got us time, time we need to move more forces to the sector.
<br>
<br>Intelligence mentioned the Imperial former 17th regular fleet is moving to the sector with 18 stardesroyers and more then 50 additional capitol ships. There are also rumors of 5 to 15 Imperial army devisions that are moving to the sector. Intel beleaves the Imperial warlord might use the sector as gate to several important Republican planetary systems.
<br>
<br>The TCSSD Amethyst belongs to Admiral Horus "Black Dagger Legion". For a long time this unit consisting of 12 Terror Class Superstardestroyers were just a rumor. The reason for this encounter between Simon's and Horus' units are not sure. We found the following log in the computer core of the Gigantic:
<br><b>
<br>An Bord der ASZ Prometheus in der N&auml;he von Erenthorosius, Thauston Planetensystem, hatte sich bereits ein gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Gruppe Offiziere angesammelt. Den Abzeichen und Uniformen nach handelte es sich hier um den Admiralsstab der imperialen Marine, doch der Schein tr&uuml;gte. Die Versammlung fand in einem eint&ouml;nig grauen Konferenzraum statt, dessen Mitte einen gro&szlig;en Konferenztisch beinhaltete, der von einer hohen Anzahl von Sitzen umringt wurde. Wie in einem Stadion waren weitere Sitzreihen um den Konferenztisch angeordnet.
<br>Als sich die Anwesenden sich gesetzt hatten, ergriff Gro&szlig;admiral Simon das Wort. "Meine Damen und Herren, ich habe sie heute hier aus folgendem Grund zusammengerufen. Vielen von ihnen sind schon &uuml;ber Teile unserer Opperation informiert, alledings werden sie heute ein Gesamtbild erhalten. Ich brauche wohl nicht zu erw&auml;hnen das das Treffen und dessen Inhalt strengster Geheimhaltung unterliegt."
<br>Michael richtete sich auf und dr&uuml;ckte mehrmals auf ein kleines Schaltfeld auf der Oberseite des Konferenztisches, worauf sich der Raum abdunkelte und eine Holoprojetion der Setorenkarte in der Mitte des Tisches erschien.
<br>"Dies ist ein Karte des aktuellen Opperationsgebietes. Unsere Kampfverb&auml;nde z&auml;hlen zur Zeit 10 Tr&auml;gergruppen. Die erste Flottenabteilung der 5ten republikanischen Flotte unter Grossadmiral Frank Andries bestehend aus den Tr&auml;gergruppen ASD Prometheus, ISZ Hamburg XII, ISZ Immortal, VSZ Ratio, die 3te Verteidigungsflotille von Delasol unter Admiral Hadrian bestehend aus den Tr&auml;gergruppen ISZ Vicious, ISZ Gigantic, VSZ Impassable, die erste Verteidigungsflottille von Mara unter Konteradmiral von Hofen bestehend aus den Tr&auml;gergruppen VSZ Immaculte und INT Hyperripper, sowie die VSZ Atradoch, die letzte verbleibende Tr&auml;gergruppe von Vizeadmiral Harkov's Flotte."
<br>Michael machte eine kurze Pause, sprach dann aber weiter. "Unser eigentliches Ziel war und ist Admiral Zaarins sogenannte Zitadelle. Einiges spricht daf&uuml;r, da&szlig; Zaarin vor seinem Verrat seine nicht vollendeten Projekte dorthin verlagert hat. Einige von Zaarins Mitarbeitern wurden aus ihrer Haft auf Bastion befreit, und sind hiereher unterwegs. Der bisherige Plan war es, sich mit ihnen zu treffen, und die Zitadelle ausfindig zu machen. Mit einigen Abwandlungen die sich durch die letzten Ereignisse ergeben haben wird dieser Plan auch durchgef&uuml;hrt.
<br>"Wie erwartet haben sich loyale imperiale Verb&auml;nde gegen uns gestellt, weswegen sie auch alle hier sind. Allerdings scheint auch Admiral Horus massiver eingreifen zu wollen, als ich gedacht hatte, wodurch sich ein zweites, lohnendes Ziel ergibt. Weitab von seinem kontrollierten Gebiet ist Horus hier ziemlich verwundbar. Admiral Andries" meine Michael und blickte in Richtung Rene Andries, der an Michaels Bericht ankn&uuml;pfte.
<br>"Wir sind mit der Immortal vor 3 Tagen in der N&auml;he von Arristotes auf eine Supersternzerst&ouml;rer der Terror Klasse gesto&szlig;en, der zu Admiral Horus Black Dagger Flotte geh&ouml;rt. Wir konnten uns nach einigen Scharm&uuml;tzeln zur&uuml;ckziehen. Zusammen mit Admiral Rechtien von der Ratio sind wir uns sicher, da&szlig; mindestenz noch ein zweiter TKSSZ sich im Sektor aufh&auml;lt allerdings gibt es keine Anzeichen auf Schiffe aus Admiral Horus regul&auml;ren Flotten.
<br>"Danke Admiral Andries" antwortete Michael "Desweiteren wird uns Admiral Zoons, Kommandant der VSZ Atradoch einen &uuml;berblick &uuml;ber die momentane Situation der loyalen imperial Streitkr&auml;fte geben.
<br></b>
<br>Intelligence Director Anthony Hall is already analysing the datas. It seems the freelancing Republican ships used a new weapon against the TCSSD, an Torpedo called "DustE". It looks like this torpedo emits particels, that is partly deflecting radar beams. Radar can find holes in the density of this particels and locate invisible slow moving capital ships that way. Tencom enterprises, the producer of that weapon on Delasol agreed in selling us several units of this torpedos. Pilots are ordered to train with them, in case there are some more of thi Black Dagger Legion ships existing.
<br>
<br>That's all for now.
<br>
<br>May the force be with you,
<br>
<br>Admiral Ackbar
</p>
<p class="textwhite"><b>Enemy sighted</b>
<br>
<br>Two X-Wings on a scout mission in the Astroid field of Parethes.
<br>
<br>CPT Psylor "Cyrus, I have a radar contact, something bigger." 
<br>CM Gustavsson "Sorry, Psylor, too many interferences from the astroids around. ... Wait ... I have 4 radar contacts straight ahead."
<br>CPT Psylor "OK, we'll take a look, but stay in the astroids field, Cyrus."
<br>CM Gustavsson "I have a bad feeling about this, Psylor."
<br>CPT Psylor "Yeah, but we need visual contact."
<br>CM Gustavsson "We should get it soon, the contacts on the radar doubleled. When we are there, my radar is completely red."
<br>CPT Psylor "OK, end of the astroid is soon field reached. Getting clear ID codes now. Battlegroup Nobilite. I see the ISD Nobilite, the FRG Bastion, the Dreadnought. ...  Whats that, that's huge."
<br>CM Gustavsson "Donno what you have on the radar, but I see 6 TIE Interceptors heading to us."
<br>CPT Psylor "They are faster, we need to escape to the astroid field. Prepare yourself for a tough run."
<br>
<br>Later this day on the CRS Hell Raiser close to the Parethes planetary system.
<br>
<br>LCM Tauron "Well, I'm Lieutenant Commander Christopher Tauron, Tactical officer from the Hell Raiser. This is Commander Breitfeld for the NRI. Vice Admiral Jedi3 and Captain Master-Qui-Gon are currently in a meeting and will join later. Commander Breitfeld had some questions for you to, cause of your report. Commander."
<br>CM Breitfeld "The radar scans had too many interferences from other objects, especially Imperial ships and fighters in the region. It's difficult to seperate a single object. I would like to know what you thought about the capital ship, Captain Psylor and Commander Gustavsson."
<br>CPT Psylor "Well, I first thought that the ship would be an medium to small size Stardestroyer. On the first view, it was a little bit smaller then the ISD Nobilite, but then I checked the radar and seen, that the ship is much behind the ISD. I think the ship is as long as an ISD and a VSD together."
<br>CM Breitfeld "Commander Gustavsson?"
<br>CM Gustavsson "Same as Captain Psylor, the ship had the typical Stardestroyer design."
<br>CM Breitfeld "Well, I will show you some newer Imperial ships on the holocam, maybe you can identify the opponent."
