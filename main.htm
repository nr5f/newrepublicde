<p class="textwhite">
Hello everyone,
<br><br>recently tried to check the internet page of one of our allies, the Star Vipers. Just got an error page so I checked a bit and it looks like the Star Vipers closed their doors:
<br><a href="http://starvipers.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Vipers_Wiki">http://starvipers.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Vipers_Wiki</a>
<br><br>It's a bit sad seeing a long time competitor in the Outer Rim War like the Star Vipers vanishing especially cause I was member in the several years ago. There aren't to many of these clubs around anymore we faced almost 10 years ago in the 1st Outer Rim War.
<br><br>Ok, the RDC has a new management now, time to see what's going on in the clubs around.

First of all apollogies for delaying the announcement more then two weeks now. I had hoped getting my private life into some order when I took the offtime two month ago, but things didn't turn out as expected.
<br>Fortunately in the 5th fleet things often proceed better when I'm not that active disturbing the peace in the fleet with unusuall plans and strategies.
<br>
<br>The topic that I didn't find time for is the reorganisation of the Republican Diplomatic Corps.
<br>First step is to announce a new Director for the Corps, it's Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler.

<p class="textwhite" align="center"><b>Fleet Command Report Part II</b><br>2nd August 2009<br><img src="roster/linie.gif"></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Hello again
<br><br>Let's proceed with the Fleet Command Report. I have mentioned a few times that we have some kind of overhaul in august. Well that is going to happen.
<br><br><b>Project S</b>
<br>Well Project S cause it is following after Project P. I will focus Project P as well later in the report. At the moment it's just important that Project P is over and Project S has started.
<br><br>Over the last one and a half month there have been a couple of smaller adjustments in the fleet. Here squadrons got dropped, there two squadrons got mergerd and somewhere else new squadrons got established. A couple of restructuration of the fleet to support this project.
<br><br>For those of you who are new in the fleet or haven't been on in June, I would like to sum up what led to this point. In our last fleet campaign we came to a point where we completed a long going chapter of the storyline of the fleet.
<br>Basically the main storyline happened in 4 chapters till now, the Imperial time, the split and the recovering, the reborn rivalty with GA Larsen and the Imperial Order, the campaign against warlord Horus. All the three capters following the Imperial one base on the rivalties with the other Imperial warlords (fictionary and non fictionary).
<br>So the fleet has come to a point where the storyline shouldn't focus anymore on our Imperial time and the revenge, it's time for the generation that joined the 5th after the split to be in the focus of storytelling. Especially now, where we have reached a timeframe of the star wars universe where the Imperial remnant isn't the thread for the New Republic anymore it was before.
<br><br>Ok, enough of the far to long prelude, let's proceed to the main focus of the project:
<br><br><b>Top S1 Storyline</b>
<br><br>I would like to start a discussion about the which direction our storyline should go, which enemies we should face, which are your Archnemesises you want to face. How the fleet should develop in this time.
<br><br><b>Top S2 Stucture</b>
<br><br>This point is reserved for a discussion about more structural changes. Well the basic idea is getting the fleet a more canon Star Wars base, away from the depth of the Expanded Universe. One thing is having ships and structures easier to recognise for those who have just seen the movies.
<br>Just to follow the fact that the main focus of the Star Wars franchise moved to other time frames in the Star Wars timeline like the Clone Wars or the Old Republican era.
<br>Ok one point in this aspect will be a changing in the squadron in the numbering: Red 2-3 -> Red 6 ; Red 4-1 -> Red 10. Will be discussed in the High Command.
<br>If you have ideas about other structural things not concerning that point about simply about adding ships or squadrons or so you can place it in this discussion as well.
<br><br><b>Top S3 Misc</b>
<br><br>There is ever a Misc.
<br><br><b>Top S4 Project R2</b>
<br><br>As mentioned before I wanted to add a few points about Project R. The outcome of Project R was really bad. In Project S we will keep the main points of Project R as side effects. If it don't works again, it will be dropped completely.
<br>Also discussions about Top S4 can be placed here as well.
<br><br>The main points of Project R:
<i>
<br><br>Well, how does it work. Well, you send me a private message with character name, callsign and e-mail adress of the officer you recruited (and maybe more optional information like preferred avatar/skills/reached ranks in other clubs/star wars games he owns).
<br>Would be good sending a copy to Matt Sifi as well. I will reply pins and temporary passwords.
<br>The recruit will bypass the academy and directly get ensign in your unit.
<br><br>Depending on how many recruits you bring and how active they initially are you will your own unit, filled with your new officers. Maybe 3 or 4 a squadron, 7,8 or 9 an own wing command, higher numbers an own ship command.
<br><br>Besides this there are some personal awards for officers:
<br>- You will earn a Blue Medallion for the first active officer you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br>- You will earn a Golden Cycle for the second active officer you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br>- You will earn a Republican Service Medal for each four officers you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br>- You will get an advantage of 2 weeks on your next promotion for each offices you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br><br>Minimum time between two promotions is one week. So if you are ensign and recruit someone, your promotion will be stored for the promotion to lieutenant, cause the required time for Second Lieutenant is just one week.
<br>So the ensign would get promoted to Second Lieutenant after one week, and after that he would get his advantage and get promoted to Lieutenant after one week.
<br>A high number of recruits can also be a reason for a promotion to Fleet Admiral, High Admiral.
<br><br>You can also negotiate with leaders of other Clubs, Fleets, Communities, Gaming Clans or however these groups are called these days to join the 5th or merge with us. If you can convince anoth smaller club to join us each member of the joining club counts as recruit for the officers responsible for the negotiations.
<br>Remember don't recruit from other clubs, negotiations with the leaders of other clubs are ok, contacting their members without the knowledge of their leaders isn't ok.
<br><br>Also, I would like to open the position of Command Assistant of the recruiting office again till August. Usually the position Command Assistant have a different meaning these days.
<br>The position is limited till August, but your current position is hold free for that time, as well as the position you would earn in the first part of the project. Usually the command assistant ribbon has been phased out, but for an successful Recruiting Officer we might make an exeption here.
<br>Any profits mentioned earlier in the project description count for the recruiting officers as well.
<br>You can send your applications to me in case you are interested in that position.

<p class="textwhite">
Hello everyone,
<br><br>well, I'm officially back now. I would like to thank High Admiral Commskywalker for taking over in that time. So I'm directly comming to two awards:
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">High Admiral Commskywalker</font> gets a Golden Cycle for his administration while I was away. Usually this would a something for giving out a Republican Service Medal, but I'm expecting Commy gets a higher medal for leading the NAC in the near future.
<br>And if I have to choose giving the higher medal for the acting FC or the NAC directorship, I tend to choose the NAC.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">High Admiral Matt Sifi</font> gets expectingly a Star of Alderaan for his long term as NAC Director. Not much to say about it, he simply did the job much better then most of his predecessors.
<br><br>Let's continue with a few regular promotions:
<br><br><img src="roster/icbra11.gif" align="left"><font color="#ffff22">Ensign John Paul Vader</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br>Congrats Lieutenant.
<br>
<br><br><img src="roster/icbra12.gif" align="left"><font color="#ffff22">Second Lieutenant Vann Daarik</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant.
<br>Congrats Lieutenant.
<br>
<br>Well the main part of the Fleet Command Report will be in Part Two, so stay tuned.

Hello everyone
<br><br>well, as mentioned before, my time is pretty much limited this monthcause of real life issues. Since there is a lot going on at the moment I came to the decision that High Admiral Commskywalker is taking over as acting Fleet Commander for this month. Will return in command in august then with the plans of the overhaul, which isn't that big anymore cause a couple of issues are already in discussion.
<br>I will not be completely away or at least try it. But for July if you have questions on promotions, direct them to Commy.
<br><br>To the promotions:
<br><br><img src="roster/icbra11.gif" align="left"><font color="#ffff22">Ensign Stefen Moss</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br><font color="#ffff22">Ensign Rove Wolf</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br><font color="#ffff22">Ensign Vann Daarik</font> is hereby promoted to Second Lieutenant.
<br>
<br>Congrats Lieutenants.
<br>
<br>Ahh, and I forgot, Medals of Communications for these three officers are on the profiles now like their other medals. And we are looking for applications for the position of NAC Director:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1846">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1846</a>

Hello everyone
<br><br>The campaign is over. It was running pretty good in the last weeks so some of my might ask why I came to the conclusion so soon, but I had mentioned before that the campaign is ending around that day and it was going for half a year now. It was about time to win the battle and give out the medals. Those of you who are interested to continue the story a bit can did it in Into the Darkness: The Aftermath:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1830">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1830</a>
<br><br>I would like to thank everyone who participated in the campaign. Campaigns are a vital part of our history and drive our storyline forward, especially this one that ended an era. It's time for writing a new chapter in our storyline now, so everyone is welcome to provide ideas for which opponent we should face now.
<br><br>Lets proceed to the medals. The second part of the Fleet Command Report will follow below the medals:</p>

<br><font color="#ffff22">Second Lieutenant Straus Doakes</font> gets a Medal of Communication for his Biography.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</font> gets a Blue Medallion for recruiting.
<br>Sure Mike Skywaler recruited Leole Skirate (Stephen Leslie Jr) a bit before Project R but since he recently got fully active I guess it's ok counting him as his first recruit for Project R.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Captain James Ory</font> gets a Star of Valor.
<br>Captain James Ory showed one of the best roleplaying performances this term and surely the best of those who haven't earned the Star of Valor already.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler</font> gets a Order of Ood Bnar.
<br>On suggestion of Vice Admiral Wolverine, Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler gets the Order of OoD Bnar for his excellent service in the Order of Jedi over the last years.
<br><br><br>The Outcome of the campaign is pretty ok with 20 individual members getting 56 medals. By the Way, the rest of the medals that got delayed a bit should be on the profiles as well as the medals for the campaign given out here.
<br><br>Like I have already mentioned in the OOC thread of the Campaign I would like to invite everyone to High Admirals Fleet Mission Run On: No More Cries. It plays in a possible future, short before the Vong Invasion.
<br><br>Before you start with the Fleet Mission Run On write your Character history what you character did in the years between our current time line (11 past Endor) and the Vong Invasion:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1640">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1640</a>
<br>For example you could still be in the Republican navy and gained some higher rank, or you could have become smuggler. You have some freedom in developing your character here. This will only count for this special FMRO, other Fleet Mission Run Ons will play in our time line again.
<br><br><br>Since the campaign is over there is a possibility again for a second parallel FMRO. If you have some experiance in the fleet and you have an idea for a story or you want to host a FMRO fell free to contact one of the council members.
<br><br><br>The Carrier Captain position of the ASD Prometheus was open for some time now and Rear Admiral Mike Skywaler represented Battlegroup One pretty well in the Fleet Campaign, so he stepped up from the position of Wing Commander of the 3rd wing to the position of Carrier Captain.
<br><br>Congrats Mike.
<br><br><br>Maybe the next Fleet Command Report is already about the overhaul in june to august. Feel free to already start discussions on the topic
<br><br>Ahh, and don't forget <b>Project R</b>. We are still in need for new recruits and it's still the fastest way to get promoted:

Hello everyone,
<br><br>come to Coruscant, fight the Vong.
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1797">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1797</a>
<br>In the Fleet Mission Run On: No More Smiles Admiral Mike Skywaler is on the way to the Outer Rim with a small expedition force, searching for Grand Admiral Commskywalker and the Bulwark Battlecruiser Zentar, not knowing about the existance of the Yuuzhan Vong ou there.
<br>In the meantime I'm summoning forces on Coruscant to reinforce the admiral. Here is a good point to join this adventure for everyone who isn't already part of this Run On.
<br>This mission plays in a possible distant future, so you have some freedom in what your character did over the years, so you can develop you character furter or try something different.
<br><br>The Fleet Mission Campaign: Into the Darkness is almost over. Maybe the last event, the 3rd part of the Run On is ending in maybe two or three weeks.
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1785">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1785</a>
<br>Time for those who haven't already played in the Campaign to make one or two posts and grap the campaign medal.
<br>Also good news for all those of you waiting for the medals you have earned in the campaign. Soon they will be given out.
<br><br>Don't forget, Project R is still ongoing an maybe the best way to boost your career.

<p class="textwhite">
Hello everyone,
<br><br>the following announcement is labaled Fleet Command Report more cause of the length and cause I may not have time for a Fleet Command Report in the next weeks then cause of the content.
<br><br>So our fleet command report here is starting with two promotions
<br><br><img src="roster/icbra15.gif" align="left"><font color="#ffff22">Commander James Ory</font> is hereby promoted to Captain.
<br>Captain Ory was pretty short in the rank of Commander. The promotion of Commander Ory came one month before the usual time because of two main reasons comming together.
<br>The first reason is Darklink showed an outstanding performance in the latest Run Ons, he made the 2nd place in the gaming part of the campaign, he showed some overall activity.
<br>Good to outstanding activity is surely not the only reason to get promoted earlier, this would be a reason for getting promoted in time not before it.
<br>The second reason is the lond delay of Captain Ory's promotion commander. Captain Ory was very long Lieutenant Commander and then when it came to a possible promotiom at the beginning of the year I was almost two month away and then when being back the promotion got delayed to the 1st march with all the promotions in that time.
<br>Congrats Darklink.
<br><br><img src="roster/icbra14.gif" align="left"><font color="#ffff22">Lieutenant Commander Jefardi</font> is hereby promoted to Commander.
<br>Commander showed very active in the IRC chat. He placed 3rd in the Trivia event. He shows activity on the message board and he is ever someone who askes for ladder games.
<br>So Jefardi really earned this promotion.
<br>Congrats Jefardi.
<br><br><br><b>What is planned for the near future?</b>
<br><br>First of all I guess we will have a conclusion of the 3rd part of the campaign run on end of this month till mid of next month.
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1785">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1785</a>
<br>The medals for the campaign will be given out short after.
<br><br>No more smiles started running again as well, and I guess it will run a bit longer, cause we are at an earlier point in the story:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1797">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1797</a>
<br>On the other hand within the time frame of a normal FMRO we are pretty late in the mission. We'll see how the FMRO develops.
<br><br>Having a second FMRO could be pretty usefull at the moment since the campaign is running out so if you like to host one or have an idea for a storyline or both, please contact a high command member of your choice to bring it up to the council.
<br><br>To the gaming aspects. The ladder term is soon over as well. There are not too many ladder games listed till now, so in most platforms it's still very easy to get even a ladder champion medal. I'm thinking on useing the ORW3 medals sceme for the ICTE for the next two month or so till the development phase.
<br><br>End of June the 1st medal term for this year end and the second begins.
<br><br>As I have mentioned before the end of the campaign will be a conclusion to the part of our storyline, where we were dealing with the Imperial Remnant especially with warlord Horus. That don't means the Imperial Remnants are completely done, but our main storyline will focus on other aspects, maybe fighting sith or so.
<br>So this is a kind of break point where we can think about a a new mission for the 5th fleet, but also about some structural changes, equipment changes, changes in general. I hoped to start an open discussion in July, but it may be August. So you have two weeks more to collect your ideas.
<br><br>You know the number of recruits shriked in the last months, we might have to discuss that as well. Usually I hope to have these topics cleared earlier. At the moment I don't really have enough time for some larger exchanges over several weeks on that topic, so a general reorientation on that topic has to wait till august.
<br>That don't means nothing can be done till then. So time to bundle a few of the existing tools on this topic and find a flashy name for it:
<br><br><br><b>Projekt R</b>
<br>(Ok, maybe finding flashy names isn't a strength of me.)
<br><br>Well, how does it work. Well, you send me a private message with character name, callsign and e-mail adress of the officer you recruited (and maybe more optional information like preferred avatar/skills/reached ranks in other clubs/star wars games he owns).
<br>Would be good sending a copy to Matt Sifi as well. I will reply pins and temporary passwords.
<br>The recruit will bypass the academy and directly get ensign in your unit.
<br><br>Depending on how many recruits you bring and how active they initially are you will your own unit, filled with your new officers. Maybe 3 or 4 a squadron, 7,8 or 9 an own wing command, higher numbers an own ship command.
<br><br>Besides this there are some personal awards for officers:
<br>- You will earn a Blue Medallion for the first active officer you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br>- You will earn a Golden Cycle for the second active officer you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br>- You will earn a Republican Service Medal for each four officers you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br>- You will get an advantage of 2 weeks on your next promotion for each offices you recruit for the fleet in this project.
<br><br>Minimum time between two promotions is one week. So if you are ensign and recruit someone, your promotion will be stored for the promotion to lieutenant, cause the required time for Second Lieutenant is just one week.
<br>So the ensign would get promoted to Second Lieutenant after one week, and after that he would get his advantage and get promoted to Lieutenant after one week.
<br>A high number of recruits can also be a reason for a promotion to Fleet Admiral, High Admiral.
<br><br>You can also negotiate with leaders of other Clubs, Fleets, Communities, Gaming Clans or however these groups are called these days to join the 5th or merge with us. If you can convince anoth smaller club to join us each member of the joining club counts as recruit for the officers responsible for the negotiations.
<br>Remember don't recruit from other clubs, negotiations with the leaders of other clubs are ok, contacting their members without the knowledge of their leaders isn't ok.
<br><br>Also, I would like to open the position of Command Assistant of the recruiting office again till August. Usually the position Command Assistant have a different meaning these days.
<br>The position is limited till August, but your current position is hold free for that time, as well as the position you would earn in the first part of the project. Usually the command assistant ribbon has been phased out, but for an successful Recruiting Officer we might make an exeption here.
<br>Any profits mentioned earlier in the project description count for the recruiting officers as well.
<br>You can send your applications to me in case you are interested in that position.

<p class="textwhite">
Hello everyone,
<br><br>the 'Into the Darkness: Old Memories' event is running for more then a week now and I only have three participiants, High Admiral Commskywalker, Rear Admiral Thes Nazud and Lieutenant Commander Jefardi.
It's really an easy way to get a medal, so I hope there are some more members take part in this event. The event is open till at least next sunday, maybe a slight bit longer depending when I'm collecting the last results.
After the campaign you have have to wait for the next campaign for simple tasks like this one.
<br><br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1792">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1792</a>
<br><br><br>In the last two month I have tried to complete a couple of tasks. Besides completing the campaign I have worked on some old code deep in the roster pages. The roster has changed a lot in the last years and there is a couple of ancient code on the roster pages and I didn't proceed as fast as I wanted.
There had been some changes with the structure of the position system that should have been changed years ago. The biggest bugs has been corrected, but there are still some minor bugs in some of the pages. So if you find a bug fell free to send me a private message on the board. Also the positions part of the admin pages hasn't been updated, may take a bit till this is working again.
Well, I may have less time for this tasks in the next months, will try to keep the campaign running and the nessesary administration done, but it might be not that regular in the next months.
<br><br>A temporary members search can be found here: <a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/roster/msearch.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/roster/msearch.htm</a>
<br><br><br>Another point is the droping number of recruits in the last months. I would like to thank High Admiral Matt Sifi on this point for helping me ensuring the joining form is still working. Since a few wekks it isn't possible anymore to register with names that contain numbers and it's not possible anymore to register with names that are already take by other members of the fleet.
This changing had been decided in the High Council years ago, but I didn't handle that task that urgent, cause it wasn't really a problem correcting the names manually, but added it with the last updates. I don't think this changes are the reason for the dropping of the cadet numbers, cause most recruits used names without numbers before.

<p class="textwhite" align="center"><b>Fleet Command Report</b><br>17th April 2009<br><img src="roster/linie.gif"></p>

<p class="textwhite">
Hello everyone, as I posted on the message board before here is the expected 2nd non Run On event of the Fleet Campaign.
<br><br><br><b>Into the Darkness: Old Memories</b>
<br><br>Well this event is a trivia event with 20 questions. You can write me a private message on the message board with the answers to the questions. I will late provide a e-mail adress as well where you can send in the answers, for those preferring not to use the message board.
<br><br>Like in the last non run on event a set of Tournament Medals wll be given out to the top 3 players, Medal of Communications to the other participating members. But only for serious participation, this means 1/3 of the questions should be answered correctly (7 questions). So the 1st half of the questions consists of pretty simple questions about the actual state of the 5th fleet. The second half requires some knowledge about the campaign itself.
<br><br>The 1st and the 2nd place are given to those members with the most and second most correct answers. In case of tiing the number of correct answers, the faster submission counts. The 3rd place ties with everyone having the same number of correct answers.
<br><br>Serious participation in this event also qualifies for the campaign medal, for those haven't already qualified in another event.
<br><br>So here are the questions:
<br><br>01) How many battlegroups does the 5th fleet have at the moment?
<br><br>02) What is the name of the Fleet Senior Officer of the fleet?
<br><br>03) What is the name of the current Carrier Captain of the VNSD Predator?
<br><br>04) Which rank (not position) does the Fleet Executive Officer have?
<br><br>05) What is the name of the flagship of Battlegroup Hunter?
<br><br>06) How many squadrons does the VNSD Predator have?
<br><br>07) Which anniversary did the 5th fleet celebrated recently?
<br><br>08) Which officer got promoted to Admiral on the anniversary?
<br><br>09) Which Fleet Command officer is managing the Fleet Mission Run On 'No More Smiles'?
<br><br>10) Which alien race is appearing in 'No More Smiles' to conquer the galaxy?
<br><br>11) What's the name of the current Fleet Campaign?
<br><br>12) What's the name of the Imperial remnant warlord the 5th fleet is opposing in that campaign?
<br><br>13) What's the name of the planetary system where the ISD Hamburg XII is protecting the refuel station in the first part of the campaign.
<br><br>14) Where is Grand Admiral Simon at the beginning of the first part of the campaign?
<br><br>15) What's the name of the planet or planetary system the 5th fleet attacked first in the campaign?
<br><br>16) How many Golan 3 Platforms protected the world?
<br><br>17) Who scored the most points in the Fleet Campaign's Gaming event Fierce Twilight?
<br><br>18) What's the name of the planetary system the 5th fleet operates in the 3rd part of the campaign?
<br><br>19) How many planets does the system have?
<br><br>20) How many SSDs does the 5th fleet confront in that system?
<br><br><br>Some small hints where to find the answers to the first 10 questions if you don't already know them. First of all the main page is ever a good source for some of these informations. Answers to questions about the roster can be found pretty easily on the roster and those about Fleet Mission Run Ons on the Roleplay Forum.
<br><br>If there are questions feel free to ask me.
<br><br><br><b>Into the Darkness: Part III, The Endless Nothing</b>
<br><br>Battlegroup One and Battlegroup Zentar have entered the arena. All three battlegroups are united now to confront the Imperial remnants in Trearian Exterrior. Members of Battlegroup One and Zentar can now take part in the Run On as well.

Hello everyone, it's time for some progress in the campaign again. The 3rd and final part of the campaign has started. You can find the run on here:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1785">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1785</a>
<br>At the moment only members of Battlegroup Hunter can take part. They have won this advantage in the Fierce Twilight event. It's up to you members of Battlegroup Hunter to use this advantage in the next one or two weeks till the other battlegroups will follow. I will try to update the setting as often as possible.
<br><br>Originally I had some slower change from part two to the final part, but there isn't so much time of my holidays left. So a couple of ideas I had won't be implemented in this campaign. I will also write a small story on how we found the location of Horus on a later date. Currently all that matters for the following storyline is that we found out the location of the Horus's fleet and Battlegroup Hunter is on the way there. Trearian Exterrior is a planetary system pretty much drifting outward of the galaxy. There are some rumors in the fleet about Sith tombs on one of the planets there.
<br><br>At least one parallel event to the Campaign Run On is still planned, will discuss this in the High Council in the next days.

High Admiral Commskywalker had recently given out the results for the Into the Darkness: Fierce Twilight competition. Congrats from my side to Vice Admiral Pat winning with an outstanding score leading Battlegroup Hunter to a clear victory in this event. I would also like to thank everyone else participating and some special thanks to High Admiral Commskywalker in managing the event. Medals will be given out at the end of the campaign.

<br><br>Well Battlegroup Hunter won so they will have the first appearance in the system with Horus's forces. I'm not sure if this will happen in part 3 or part 4 of the story, cause I'm not sure if I have a small interlude part between the current and the last part of the campaign or not, cause I would like to complete the campaign in this turn. One thing for sure, there will be a small break point after part 2 so the changings that has happened in the fleet will be transferred into the campaign as well. So ranks will be up to date and the changings inthe command structure of Battlegroup Zentar will apear as well.

So the topic indicates that the time is progressing. That's usually a good point catching up with the events to get some medals.
<br><br>First of all is the anniversary medal, till friday you can still qualify for getting the anniversary medal by posting a birthday with to the fleet in the anniversary topic on the mesage board:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1743">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1743</a>
<br><br>Well, the next event I'm mentioning ends at sunday. Your battlegroup needs urgent support here. Every participation in Into the Darkness II(b) Fierce Twilight gets points for your battlegroup, you don't need to complete the game, just make a few tries and send in your best score. It will help your battlegroup to get advance in the campaign besides earning your some medals.
<br>Simply play the game <a href="http://theclonewars.cartoonnetwork.com/games/game_01.html">http://theclonewars.cartoonnetwork.com/games/game_01.html</a> make a screenshot of your score and send it to High Admiral Commskywalker.
<br>More informatins can be found here: <a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1761">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1761</a>
<br><br>Also the Run Ons made some steps ahead. High Admiral Commskywalker's Fleet Mission Run On 'No More Smiles' will surely be up again soon, and it's still pretty much at the beginning, so it's a good chance for everyone who didn't already take part to join in, especially those who asked for that Run On over the last months.
<br><br>Finally the Campaign Run On 'Into the Darkness Part II' also welcomes every additional player that wants to take part.

Well, hello everyone, as I have noteded last week the Run Ons have started again. So there are a couple of event I would like to introduce to those who didn't already take notice of.
<br><br><br><b>Fleet Mission Run On
<br>No More Smiles - Part I</b>
<br><br>High Admiral Commskywalker takes the fleet to a scenario in the future (relaying to our timeline, sure Star Wars plays long ago in a galaxy far away) As most members requested the FMRO plays in the time where the shadow appeared on the horizon of the galaxy. Grand Admiral Commskywalker, the current leader of the 5th fleet has already encountered the danger only mentioned in rumors till then, while the government on Coruscant is still unaware what they are confronted with.
<br><br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1752">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1752</a>
<br><br>The Run On has already started but is still in the beginning phase, so it's very easy to introduce your character in the Run On and you have some freedom in further development, like what you have done in the last 11 years between the timelines. Like getting merried, getting promoted, retired from active service. 11 years are a lot of time and you have some freedom in developing your character, just make sure to post a small summary in the following message board thread so the other Run On players know as well:
<br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1640">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1640</a>
<br><br><br><b>Fleet Campaign
<br>Into the Darkness - Part II</b>
<br><br>Into the Darkness plays in our current timeline. The war in the Outer Rim region against the warlord of the Imperial Remnant Grand Admiral Victor 'Horus' Sunmin is in his last stages. When the 5th fleet enters the battlezone around Horus' capital world Zarathos, they notice Horus and his key units has already left the system, but still leaving a large group of Remnant warships and planetary defenses there. Will the 5th fleet be able to conquer the system to be able to follow Horus' trail.
<br><br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1757">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1757</a>
<br><br>As mentioned the week before, this is dedicated to be the end of the storyline with warlord Horus that officially started 2003 with the Remnants of the past campaign. Technically he appeared a bit further by defeating the remnants of Count Donaarn's forces, our archenemy during the Imperial time fo the 5th fleet. The time between is more or less filled with the rivalty with the Imperial Order, the alliance with the Rebel Squadrons and the great campaigns between these clubs and others such as the first two Outer Rim Wars, the Inter Club melee and the beginnings of the Inter Club Training Event. Sure it would be cool have many participiants here giving the storyline a dramatic ending.
<br><br><br><b>Fleet Campaign
<br>Into the Darkness - Part IIa</b>
<br><br>First gaming event in the campaign. You're a pilot in the battle at Zarathos and you got cut off your squadron. Now you have to fight your way back through the hordes of opponents attacking you.
<br><br><a href="http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1761">http://www.fifthnet.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1761</a>
<br><br>Basically you have to play the following Star Wars flash game:
<br><a href="http://theclonewars.cartoonnetwork.com/games/game_01.html">http://theclonewars.cartoonnetwork.com/games/game_01.html</a>
<br>Make a screenshot of your best score and send it to High Admiral Commskywalker.

Another year has passed, usually a pretty nostalgic moment, cause for a fleet like the 5th fleet it's a long time. We started in the early days of multiplayer gaming in internet and somehow we are still here. I guess High Admiral Commskywalker found some better words on the ceremony, for those who missed it High Admiral Matt Sifi will make a small log accessable as reference. Once again thanks from my side to everyone who had been loyal to the fleet over the years.
<br><br><br>A quick jump to the promotions. Usually promotions are more spread over the time, but this time a couple of promotions came together. Sure we have sheduled the promotions especially for this day, but there are also requirements that qualify for promotions so there it's a small coincidence or the plan of the force we so many officers reaching that point in ths small timeframe.
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Vice Admiral Darth Boy</font> is hereby promoted to Admiral
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Rear Admiral Raul Jaknae</font> is hereby promoted to Vice Admiral
<br><font color="#ffff22">Rear Admiral Soniv Hope</font> is hereby promoted to Vice Admiral
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Commodore Thes Nazud</font> is hereby promoted to Rear Admiral
<br><font color="#ffff22">Commodore Ash Halcyon</font> is hereby promoted to Rear Admiral
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Captain Liedan Aish</font> is hereby promoted to Commodore
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Lieutenant Commander James Ory</font> is hereby promoted to Commander
<br><font color="#ffff22">Lieutenant Commander Aleksandr</font> is hereby promoted to Commander
<br><font color="#ffff22">Lieutenant Commander John Witwalker</font> is hereby promoted to Commander
<br><br><font color="#ffff22">Lieutenant Jefardi</font> is hereby promoted to Lieutenant Commander
<br><br>I would like to congrat everyone on their promotions.
<br><br><br>Well the last point from my side today is a sneak peak to the future. I guess a couple of you have mentioned High Admiral Commskywalker's Fleet Mission Run On. Playing in the scenario a many member here were favored far in the expanded universe with new equipment and a new worthy opponent. I'm pretty much curious how Commy does as Fleet Commander and Grand Admiral. 
<br><br>Annother point is, I guess I will continue with the campaign in the very near future. Just to bring this storyline to an end. Well the story pretty much started with the end of the Outer Rim conflicts and the competition with the Imperial Order in the year 2003 (8 years past Endor) and it's pretty much time to bring this storyline to an conclusion now, 11 years past Endor when the influence of the Imperial Remnant is shrinking.
<br><br>After the campaign, well, I think we will make a wider focus on other opponents of the Republic, maybe seeing what we can do in matter of Inter-Club gaming.
<br><br><br>Ah, before I forget it, anniversary medals will be given out in later march together with those who earned the medal, or will earn it, through the anniversary topic on the message board.

Hello everyone,
<br><br>well I have made myself ultra rare in the last two months, was triing to get my mind free for the tests in the last weeks. I had started the university pretty slowly and have to catch up everything now. so I guess my time will be pretty li,ited this year as well, like in the last year.
<br><br>I have noticed the threads about problems with the message board. So I can't say if there is already a thread about the anniversary, but in the age of multithreading it shouldn't be too much of a problem having more then one thread. The procedure this year will be like every year I guess. If i'm not able to be on the channel it would be cool if someone puts up a log who was on.
<br><br><a href="http://www.newrepublic.de/gaming/ladder08.htm">http://www.newrepublic.de/gaming/ladder08.htm</a>
<br>Ladder 2008 has been updated, the Medals should be on the profiles of the officers now.
