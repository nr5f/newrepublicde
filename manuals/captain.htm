<center><h1>Commanding a ship<br><img src="../roster/linie.gif"></h1></center>

<br>

<p class="textwhite">Bigger warships are often equipped with one or more fighter or bomber squadrons. Four or more squadrons are usually organized within a wing. Ships with less the four squadrons usually don't have their squadrons assigned to wings. Ships with four or more squadrons have all their squadrons assigned within wings.</p>

<h1>Personnel Management</h1>
<p class="textwhite">
Besides the communication with the officers on the ship and their instructions, similar to the duties of the Squadron Commander the Carrier Captain also has to manage the personnel on his ship.
<br>He decides the squadrons officers get assigned too and how the reserve officers get assigned. He can sort squadrons for the gaming platform the members use most of the time or he can sort squadrons by activity having squadrons for reserves, squadrons for recruits and normal active members and top squadrons for very active members.
<br>Reserve officers can also be placed as crewmembers on the ship till they return to activity and get assigned to a squadron again. The Carrier Captain has a lot of possibilities in assigning members very individual from ship to ship, therefore the Carrier Captain has a high responsibility in managing a ship efficiently.
<br>The Wing Commander can take up these duties partially or completely from the Carrier Captain, if the captain wishes so.
<br>
<br><b>Crewmembers</b>
<br>Crewmember is the basic position on a capitol ship. Crewmember just means someone is assigned to a ship and don't has a specified position on the ship, so the position of Crewmember is pretty multifunctional.
<br>On one hand Reserves can be placed as Crewmembers, cause the number of Crewmembers is not really limited to a specific number so the Reserves don't take away positions from active officers. The Crewmember position is also useful for members who prefer not to play pilots in Roleplaying games and Run On stories, like Jedi or Diplomats from the specific subgroups. Also for veterans that don't like to get orders from Squadron and Wing Commanders.
<br>The position of Crewmember is not thought for new members in ranks below Lieutenant. For better orientation in the fleet graduates from the Naval Academy usually get assigned directly to squadron, where Squadron and Wing Commander help them orienting in the fleet. Nevertheless, this is just a guideline in the 5th fleet, for example on the Prometheus it's a tradition officers must have reached the ranking of Lieutenant before they get assigned to squadrons.
<br>
<br><b>Deck Officers</b>
<br>Deck Officers in the 5th fleet are usually the commanding officers in key position on a carrier like First Officer, Tactical Officer, Communications Officer and officers in similar positions.
<br>Deck Officers are positions for experienced Roleplayers and honorary veterans of the ship, outside of the Roleplaying games the Deck Officers don't have abilities to decide on personnel management of the 5th fleet.
<br>
<br><b>Transfers</b>
<br>It's a tradition in the 5th fleet that officers that graduated from the academy and got transferred to a ship get assigned to the squadron of the recruiter, in case there was someone recruiting the new members. Usually it's expected from a Carrier Captain and a Wing Commander that they respect these tradition.
<br>The term transfers is more used for movement between ships. Generally the Carrier Captain and the Wing Commander have veto rights against transfers in and out a ship, but there are a few issues where Carrier Captains can't forbid transfers from a ship: An transfer of an officer to a different ship, cause he has personnel problems with one of his superior officer, if he gets transferred cause he got an offer about a higher position on a different ship that isn't available on the ship he is on, or a general restructuring of the fleet.
</p>

<h1>Assigning to Command Positions</h1>
<p class="textwhite">
The most difficult assignments are those to command positions. Wing Commanders and Squadron Commanders can have a lot of influence on their members so members with some loyalty to the fleet and experience are often preferred for such positions.
<br>Many members in the fleet would think some leadership abilities are important for such positions, but usually it's less important for a squadron to reach specific tasks and high quotes then to have fun and find friends, so social skills are often more useful in these positions.
<br>
<br><b>Wing Commander</b>
<br>The Wing Commander is one of the top positions in the fleet. These positions are pretty rare in the fleet and have much influence even on top decisions of Fleet Command and High Command. Besides that they have a few direct command abilities and often qualify theirself for seats within the High Command. So usually it's expected that experienced members get selected for getting Wing Commanders.
<br>Wing Commanders can take over most duties from the Carrier Captain.
<br>
<br><b>Squadron Commander</b>
<br>The Wing Commander and the Carrier Captain can assign Squadron Commanders to the different squadrons. Squadron Commanders should be active a least if they get assigned to active squadrons.
</p>

<h1>Acting and Trial Commanders</h1>
<p class="textwhite">
<b>Acting Commanders</b>
<br>When a Carrier Captain is away, he can make a Wing Commander or Squadron Commander acting Carrier Captain. An acting Carrier Captain can manage the personnel on the ship and can command the ship in Roleplaying games, but can't promote or give out medals like a Carrier Captain.
<br>
<br><b>Command Positions on Trial</b>
<br>Officers in command positions that haven't reached a specified ranking have their positions on trial. These are Carrier Captains below the ranking of Captain, Wing Commanders below the ranking of Commander, Squadron Commanders below the ranking of Lieutenant Commander and Vice Squadron Commander below the ranking of Lieutenant. Commanders on trial can't promote nor give out medals.
</p>

<h1>Medals</h1>
<p class="textwhite">
Most of the medals are given after commissioned competitions such as gaming nights, gaming ladder, inter club tournaments, campaigns, fleet mission run ons or fleet wide competitions. This competitions are usually given out by the Fleet Council and the officer that hosts the event gives out the medals if he is Wing Commander or higher. Since these medals are given out by the manager of such an even that don't need to be Wing Commander or Carrier Captain, these medals aren't the typical medal given out by the officers in the ship command.
<br><br>More important medals for the Carrier Captains and the Wing Commanders are the two medals below, the Carrier Captain Award and the Wing Commander Award. Members of a ship or wing can award these medals to honor their service in the specified unit. Wing Commander and Carrier Captains can give the medal out for special deeds or long time service to members of their unit, only restriction is that the medal can only be given out and awarded once per medal term. (That's half a year.)
</p>
<table border="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">
<tr><td align="center"><img src="../main/medcca.gif" border="0"></td><td valign="top">
<p class="textwhite"><b>Carrier Captain Award</b>
<br>The Carrier Captain is an award that is only given out by Carrier Captains only once a medal term. Medal terms are January to June and July to December. The medal is given out to a member of the ship (except of the Carrier Captain) that shows an extraordinary performance on the ship. An officer can only get one Carrier Captain Award or one Wing Commander Award per medal term.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><img src="../main/medwca.gif" border="0"></td><td valign="top">
<p class="textwhite"><b>Wing Commander Award</b>
<br>The Wing Commander Award is similar to the Carrier Captain Award, it can only be given out by the Wing Commander once a medal term. Medal terms are January to June and July to December. The medal is given out to a pilot of the wing (except of the Wing Commander) that shows an extraordinary performance in the wing. An officer can only get one Carrier Captain Award or one Wing Commander Award per medal term.
</p></td></tr></table>
<p class="textwhite">
<b>Medals for Creating Content</b>
<br>Carrier Captains and Wing Commanders can award their members medals for creating content such as creating graphics, images, videos, background stories for ship, wing or squadron pages, office or profile pages, or for creating the pages itself. Usually these medals are given out once when the officer completed the profile or the squadron page, and not for each small element he adds or update he does. The medals are also given for content the Carrier Captain and the Wing Commander specially request to be made for ship or wing page.
<br>A Medal of Communication is given out for a smaller contribution, for bigger ones general honor medals can be given out up to a Republican Service Medals for large and important contributions.
<br>
<br><b>Medals for Long Time Service</b>
<br>Officers that have served as Vice Squadron, Squadron or Wing Commander and retire from their position can get a general honor medal up to a Republican Service Medal from the Carrier Captain or the Wing Commander. The officer should have served several month to years active in a position before he gets medals, and officers that leave a position to get promoted into a higher position don't count for these medals as well.
</p>

<h1>Promotions</h1>
<p class="textwhite">
Technically Carrier Captains can promote all officers assigned to their ships except of theirself and officers Group Commander positions or higher up to a ranking of Captain. Wing Commanders can promote members assigned to squadrons of their wing up to a ranking of Captain.
<br>These promotions done be Carrier Captains and Wing Commanders therself are called Field Promotions and are usually done in periods where the Fleet Council isn't available. Normally promotions are suggested to the Fleet Council.
<br>
<br>Carrier Captains and Wing Commanders can also suggest promotions to direct line commander. Usually in case of promotions higher then to a ranking of Captain, promotions in different units or just in case the officers want another opinion on the matter.
</p>

<h1>Promotion Guideline</h1>
<p class="textwhite">
Basically an Ensign that is very active for a week gets promoted to Second Lieutenant, a Second Lieutenant that is very active for two weeks gets promoted to Lieutenant, a Lieutenant that is very active for four weeks gets promoted to Lieutenant Commander and so on.
<br>Very active means officers show an exhausting activity on a single area without penetrating other members, or show good activity in multiple competitions and communication forms. Officers showing lower activity need longer to get promoted.
<br>The effort to get the next ranking doubles each time. The structure was concepted that way, but has been a bit weakened for the ranks of Vice Admiral and Admiral later.
</p>
<table>

<td valign="top"><p class = "textwhite">Honorary promotion for Fleet Admirals simply making the club a better place</p></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><p class = "textwhite">&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p class="textwhite">
The assigned times to the promotions are also the minimum time you have to be in a rank to get the next rank. There are three exceptions where promotions can be done earlier.
<br>Recruiting is usually a reason to get promoted or other successful actions for bringing more members into the fleet like convincing other clubs to join us. A second possibility is playing for the 5th fleet in inter club tournaments and a third possibility for officers owning the ranking Captain and above is being in administrational positions. This can even count for Squadron and Vice Squadron Commanders or positions in subgroups, temporary commanders or even administrative functions without having specific positions.
<br>The minimum time between two promotions in the officer ranks is one week.
